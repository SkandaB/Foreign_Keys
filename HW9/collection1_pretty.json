Using 0.5l beer of 20C and 0.5l rock (1kg!) of -10C you get the beer to 10C. Using (as pictured on the site) one 1.25\" cube, or 20cc (40g) of rock per 1 bottle of 500cc of beer, you get 1:50 ratio (40J/K to 2000J/K), frozen to -60C would bring the glass merely from 20 to 18C.",

Glass-making in England was then in its infancy; the first glass-making factory had only recently been established. Many of the first yard glasses have not survived due to their brittle nature, until George Ravenscroft (1674) introduced a new glass process known as the flint glass.</p>\n  \n  <p>The yard of ale was made and used not for normal drinking purposes, but for feast and manly displays of prowess. During Anglo-Saxon times through the Middle Ages, the English nation has always engaged in the traditions of heavy drinking. As put in Young’s quote “England’s Bane” written in 1617, “He is a man of no fashion that can not drink by the dozen, by the yard, so by measure we drink out of measure.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Legend suggests that the yard was also used in old England to serve the driver of a coach. Upon arriving at their destination and relieving its passengers, the coachman would stay and the length of the yard glass would allow him some refreshment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some of the same information is repeated in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_of_ale\">Wikipedia</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm certain that most of the history of using this style of vessel comes from fellow drinkers trying to show each other up at parties, but aside from the sheer volume (and perhaps limitations of glass-making artisans), how did this length and volume of the glass first come about?  Is there more definitive evidence for the year of birth of the yard, besides the milestone in their history of the introduction of flint glass? </p>\n\n<p>I'm also curious about whether the volume of the glass was satisfying to stagecoach drivers because of their need to wait long periods for their passenger, or whether it was just easier to hand them a tall glass as they remained in the seat. </p>\n",

(That question was about a stout.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't have a <em>lot</em> of experience with this, but until now when I've ordered lagers they've generally come in a tall glass (not curved).  A few days ago I ordered a <a href=\"http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/169/449/\">Stella Artois</a> and it came in the following glass:<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jyK4j.jpg\" alt=\"glass\"></p>\n\n<p>(The glass was full when delivered; I didn't think to take a picture for this question right away.)</p>\n\n<p>This glass does not concentrate aromas to the extent that a brandy snifter does; further, this beer did not seem to be particularly aromatic.  (I've never had this one before, which is why I ordered it.)  Nor is it a highly-alcoholic or expensive beer that they might want to serve in a smaller quantity.  I'd guess this glass to have been in the 10-12oz range.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a benefit to the mildly curved shape of this glass for this type of beer?  I note that it's a Stella Artois glass, so presumably it's not <em>just</em> a bartender's arbitrary choice.</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> I was traveling, so I can't just go visit them again to see how they serve other beers.</p>\n",

The company did not spend sufficient time testing the new process, and tiny green flakes appeared in the beer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Internet sleuthing reveals <a href=\"http://www.beerconnoisseur.com/the-fall-of-schlitz\" rel=\"nofollow\">this <em>Beer Connoisseur</em> article</a>, which gives more info and claims that the flakes were, in fact, white:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Schlitz decided to use another beer stabilizer instead, one that would be filtered out of the final product and thus would not have to be listed as among the ingredients. Unfortunately, what Schlitz's brewing technicians did not know was that the new anti-haze agent, called Chill-garde, would react in the bottles and cans with the foam stabiliser they also used, to cause protein to settle out. At its best this protein looked liked tiny white flakes floating in the beer and at its worst it looked like mucus, or \"snot,\" as one observer bluntly called it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After more research, I can't find any other references to Schlitz being [literally] green. As a beer lover and homebrewer, this inconsistency is driving me nuts. Does anyone know <em>which</em> color the flakes in Schlitz were in the mid-1970s? I have the following hypotheses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Beer Connoisseur</em> also mentions that Schlitz switched from whole to pellet hops; coupled with inadequate filtration, this could have led to green flakes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Adults doing research thought of \"snot\" like kids, which meant that a \"snotlike\" substance in beer was probably green.</p></li>\n<li><p>This is a misunderstanding created by non-brewers reading that Schlitz was \"green\" (which does appear frequently in search results); combined with knowing that there were flakes, and that the liquid of beer is generally amber-ish, it must have been [to someone unfamiliar with \"green beer\" being beer which needs to be further aged] that the flakes were literally green.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Beer Connoisseur</em> is wrong, and the flakes were in fact green.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Does anyone have first-hand experience with this era of beer?</p>\n",

I also know that, in between those two extremes, the relationship is <em>not</em> linear (<em>e.g.</em>, 3.2% ABW is approximately 4.0% ABV). However, any web-site calculator that I see pretty much performs the calculation as linear.</p>\n\n<p>I've been fiddling with my TI-89 from high school, and I think that I have it figured out. Assuming ethyl alcohol has a density of .789 kg/l and water has a density of 1 kg/l and assuming that water and alcohol are the only substances in an alcoholic beverage (which I know isn't true), the formula is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ABV = ABW ÷ (.211 · ABW + .789)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that I can't confirm my formula. I'm searching Google and can't find much on the topic. Well… I can find plenty of calculators, but they all seem to be using a linear formula.</p>\n\n<p>So… is this formula correct?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: So, I've done a little more tweaking on this (after I already got the accepted answer). I already made the assumption that the density of water is 1 kg/l. The density that I used for ethyl alcohol was for 20°C. At that same temperature, water has a density of approximately .99823 kg/l and not 1 kg/l. Using this, I arrived at a different formula that's probably more accurate (at 20°C, that is):</p>\n\n<pre><code>ABV = (99823 · ABW) ÷ (20923 · ABW + 78945)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>EDIT: Please see AlkonMikko's comment.</p>\n",

But I'm really wondering here.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Setting up mash means dropping some corn and water into an ugly barrel, and add a sack full of sugar (like... 25 kilograms?), this gives you alcohol ready to distill in two, at most three days. Old barrel with wooden lid, no fermentation lock needed.<br>\nIn winemaking, while adding sugar is often frowned upon anyway, regardless of what you do, you generally try hard <strong>not</strong> to get the sugar contents too high at the beginning since that <em>inhibits</em> fermentation. Using any old barrel for fermentation is... well, something you <em>can</em> probably do, but would one want to?</p></li>\n<li><p>20 liters distilled give 8 liters of 50-55% moonshine. Since alcohol does not appear out of nowhere, this means the mash must necessarily have 20% of alcohol. That's quite steep for a random mix of stuffs in an old barrel. My yeast usually tolerates 16-18% at most. Admitted, there are special high-alcohol yeasts as well as \"turbo\" yeasts, but they make no mention of any such thing.</p></li>\n<li><p>You get mash ready to distill in two days (20% in 2 days, that's, well... wow) but if you heat it up to around 70°C (so, basically killing the yeast!), you can do it in hours, not days.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using a \"booster\" which is basically a second cooling spiral in a box, doubles the amount of alcohol you get out. As does a cooling spiral in the main tank.\nSince the booster cannot possibly create alcohol out of nowhere, does that mean that one normally operates at below 50% efficiency?</p></li>\n<li><p>Making the distill from copper is useful because it absorbs the large amounts of sulfur dioxide that are generated during fermentation. More copper, more good.<br>\nIn winemaking, if you get noticeable amounts of sulfur dioxide, it means you fucked up the fermentation (except when making fruit wine from oranges, there it's pretty common).</p></li>\n<li><p>Malted corn needs no yeast for fermentation, and you get no headaches from it that way. I'm inclined to believe the opposite as far as headaches go, since no yeast means you run a wild fermentation. In winemaking, this is normally something that you absolutely want to avoid if you can help it. Wild fermentation, and rapid, ultra-high alcohol production?</p></li>\n<li><p>Moonshine sells for 25-30 dollars per liter. Not sure about alcohol prices in the USA, but I can buy alcohol <em>legally</em> (and not made from river water in a dirty barrel) for that amount of money here.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, is there anything in there which (apart from running when police shows up) is even remotely realistic?</p>\n",

The wine is also a symbol of the great love of Christ that filled St. John’s heart with loyalty, courage, and enthusiasm. - <a href=\"https://gnosticdevotions.wordpress.com/2013/12/27/blessing-of-the-wine-of-st-john/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gnostic Devotions.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our Pastor is okay with the idea but has set down a few desirable traits he would like to see with the wine. The Wine should have the following characteristics:</p>\n\n<p>1.The wine should be red, as a symbolic color of St John's martyrdom. Non-red wines will be considered too.</p>\n\n<p>2.The price range should be no more than $20.00 a bottle.</p>\n\n<p>3.The label should be modest and if possible make some sort of reference to St John if possible or some other religious theme, if a St John theme cannot be found. </p>\n\n<p>Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n",

Others have started to go off after six months or a year (but were fine before that).  The meads are bottled in capped (usually) 12oz brown bottles stored in a dark basement, and it doesn't seem to be about individual bottles.  This seems to be a case of \"some recipes keep longer than others\".  I'd like to know what properties contribute to this.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the batch that has kept well for the longest (over 10 years now! I've been saving the last few bottles...) was <em>very</em> high-gravity for a mead; it's strong, sweet, and very smooth.  But another moderately-high-gravity mead degraded after a year or so, and lower-gravity ones have sometimes lasted longer.  So it seems like there must be other factors at play; it doesn't seem to be as simple as \"stronger (or sweeter) meads keep longer\".</p>\n\n<p>Our production techniques have been about as consistent as home-brewing can be -- same equipment, same general process, same cellars, same fastidiousness about sanitation.  Varieties of honey and yeast have varied, and of course recipes have too.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a home-brewing question; I'm not asking specifically how to <em>make</em> long-lived mead.  Rather, I'm asking what characteristics allow a mead to age longer without going off, which also helps me decide what to drink.</p>\n\n<p>I know that commercial meads exist, by the way, but I have never encountered one.</p>\n",

Another thought is that you may be aerating some batches during bottling, or your bottle caps are not sealed properly, which can negatively affect the taste.
