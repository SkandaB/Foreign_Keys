Interestingly doesn\'t work for rice.</li>\n<li>helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.

It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.</p>\n\n<p>As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It\'s very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).</p>\n\n<p>If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don\'t know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine\'s time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English \"beor\" means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn\'t get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don\'t think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.</p>\n\n<p>Now as for lager, these are far more recent.</p>\n\n<p>Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than \"flat\" beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.

Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.</p>\n  \n  <p>As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman\'s body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.</p>\n\n<h2>Beer and couples</h2>\n\n<h3>Men</h3>\n\n<p>Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men\'s testosterone levels to hit that \"comfortable\" level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don\'t entice sexual encounters and won\'t lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.</p>\n\n<h3>Women</h3>\n\n<p>While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.</p>\n\n<p>Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes</p>\n','2014-01-22 22:23:34'),(240,27,'<p>A Christmas Ale seems to be another term for a \"<a href=\"http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style21.php#1b\">Winter Warmer</a>\" beer -- a dark, malty beer (raisins, dark fruit) meant to be enjoyed in colder months, with a warming effect, either from the actual alcohol, or spices it was brewed with (think nutmeg, clove, that sort of thing).

These are reduced by reducing the amount of non-fermentable sugars, such as by adjusting the recipe to avoid malts that contain unfermentable sugars (such as Cara/Crystal malts, and highly kilned malts). Also the brewer can adjust the temperature that the grains are mashed to produce a more fermentable wort with less residual sugar.</p>\n\n<p>To see how alcohol and carbs affect the calories in beer, here\'s an excerpt from <a href=\"http://www.beer100.com/beercalories.htm\">this table</a> that lists the % abv, grams of carbohydrates in a 12.oz serving:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Name        Brewer          abv     cal.    carbohydrates\nBusch Ice   Anheuser Busch  5.9%    169 12.5g     \nBusch Light Anheuser Busch  4.1%    95  3.2g\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The light beer has considerably less calories than the regular beer. In fact, around 80% of the calories in that beer come from the alcohol:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1 g of alcohol = 7 kcal. \n\n1 g of carbohydrate = 4 kcal.\n\nVolume of beer is 12oz. x 28.6g = 343ml.  Volume of alcohol is 4.1 % x\n343 = 14 ml\n\nTo convert alcohol volume to weight, divide by 1.25. Weight of alcohol\nis 14 / 1.25 = 11.2g \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Energy from alcohol is 11.2 x 7 = 78.4 kcal. As percent: 78.4/95 =\n  <strong>82%</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>Energy from carbs is 3.2 x 4 = 12.8. As percent: 12.8/95 = <strong>13%</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The total is less than 100% - the data doesn\'t account for protein, which is typically about 1g/12oz, which is about 4 kcal.)</p>\n\n<p>By brewing the beer with an even lower %abv, the beer would be even lighter in calories, but possibly at the expense of flavor.</p>\n','2014-01-23 06:54:13'),(253,112,'<p>For a keg system to pour beer without excessive foam, the system must be balanced, and the serving line/faucet free of obstructions.

So part of it has to do with the character of beer.</p>\n\n<p>There are two important factors I see, looking at this as a history nut but not knowing of any sources on this topic.  The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.  But this was not the major factor in cold beverages generally since ice was often preserved into the summer for cooling beverages (and has been since ancient times).  But refrigeration makes this easier and thus cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>The second is actually the modern bottlecap which is a product of industrialization.  Before the bottlecap most beers were served uncarbonated.  They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.</p>\n\n<p>To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.

While hops were used in medicine, the major national herbals of Anglo-Saxon England don\'t mention them.  That we have strong references in early 8th century England (see \"Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink\" by Ann Hagen) to comparatively large-scale cultivation of hops strongly suggests they were used in brewing.</p>\n\n<p>Hops are used in medicine as well, but the amounts used there are very small in comparison to those used for brewing, and the two major Anglo-Saxon national herbals, Bald\'s Leechbook and The Lacnunga don\'t mention them (I think the Old English Herbarium does, but it is a translation into Old English of a continental Latin work).  Keep in mind most of my work with these has been in translation (Pollington\'s) and translating plants from the descriptions often poses interesting issues.  I could probably find standarized editions in Old English if needed however.</p>\n\n<p>One of the interesting connections here is that two of the most important early brewing herbs, hops and henbane, both had strong connections to female medical concerns (this is also interesting because historically brewing was women\'s work, hence the obsolete term \"alewife\" not referring to a fish--- the woman\'s place in keeping a tavern was privileged but brewing was sort of like cooking, something every woman was supposed to know).  Hops to heavy periods, and henbane was used to address pain in childbirth.  Both of these may contribute to Bald\'s warning that pregnant women may drink ale safely but not beer, for beer would cause a risk of miscarriage.</p>\n\n<p>In general for hops to be grown to an extent noteworthy, one is almost certainly talking about brewing, whether grains or honey, and whether alone or with other herbs.</p>\n','2014-01-23 09:46:52'),(262,112,'<p>I would say that the condensate amounts to no more than 1ml for a 500ml glass, which is a 0.2% dilution. </p>\n\n<p>No to be too coarse, but I imagine most people dilute the beer more after taking a sip! </p>\n\n<p>Comparatively, I think the excessively cold temperature will contribute more to destroying the flavor than a small amount of condensate from the glass. </p>\n\n<p>So, if you enjoy the beer in a frozen glass, then keep at it. </p>\n','2014-01-23 12:23:47'),(263,8,'<p>That is the difference.

Even with the increases, the gulf in capacity between \'craft\' and the various major macrobrewers is so large as to render the adjustments to the definition of \'craft\' largely benign. The additional standards that a so called \'craft\' brewery must restrict the use of cheap adjuncts in their grain bill keeps out the few smaller regional breweries that might otherwise fall under the umbrella.

Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.

It isn\'t a question of availability today but there are other factors that likely have seasonal impact.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally (say, 1000 years ago), yes, brewing recipes would vary with the seasons.  Some ingredients like henbane seed or barley keep extremely well.  Others do better  fresh (herbs and such).  It is likely that gruit components varied with the seasons.  This is not an issue today.  Aside from some components of other beers (pumpkin ale, beers with seasonal fruit), most beers today do not involve ingredients that are problematic to preserve over a year.</p>\n\n<p>There is a second issue though.  That is that beers traditionally have another factor which is starch content.  The starch contributes significantly to calorie count of the beer, and usually darker, richer beers have higher carbohydrate count.  It makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather, and it makes sense that darker, heavier beers would be favored in winter while lighter beers would be favored in summer (although as one would note the heavier beers came out of traditions of using them as bread substitutes for fasting monks and so would have year-round applicability in monasteries).</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t think it has to do with availability.  I think instead it has to do with seasonal expectations and reserving richer, heavier, higher starch beers for the winter (we have higher metabolism in winter, see <a href=\"http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf</a>, and generally less availability of fresh foods before modern refrigeration and rapid transport).  I don\'t know when this became common though.  In general, when I look back a thousand years ago, I don\'t see anything in primary sources to suggest heavier malts in the winter.  So trying to date this would seem speculative.  There is a fairly obvious practical pattern though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  As I think about this, I would note that aside from lagers, it is very hard to brew in the winter in a colder climate.

Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.</p>\n\n<p>The answer I think to the question as stated has to be \"no\" insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn\'t always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England</strong></p>\n\n<p>This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else\'s well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).</p>\n\n<p>If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald\'s Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while \"<em>ealu</em>\" (-> ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, \"<em>beor</em>\" (-> beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (\"Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink\") suggests that \"beor\" must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources on history</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hagen, Ann.  \"<em>Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink</em>\"</li>\n<li>Pollington, Stephen.  \"<em>Leechcraft</em>\" (for an edition of Bald\'s Leechbook with facing page translation).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:  Medieval Iceland</strong></p>\n\n<p>The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (<em>godhi</em>, <em>bondi</em>, and <em>thrall</em>) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a <em>godhi</em> (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a <em>godhord</em> (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A <em>bondi</em> (free juryman) owned land.  And a <em>thrall</em> was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill\'s Saga, Njall\'s Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from \"continental\" Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki\'s Saga.</p>\n\n<p>In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It\'s probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There\'s a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>Further reading:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the various sagas referenced above.</li>\n<li>The <em>Poetic Edda</em> (I usually recommend the Hollander translation if you are going to work in translation because he tends to be transparent about which emendations he is using).</li>\n<li>Byock, Jesse:  <em>Viking-Age Iceland</em></li>\n<li>Byock, Jesse:  <em>Medieval Iceland</em></li>\n<li>Roesdahl, Else: <em>The Vikings</em></li>\n<li>Pollington, Stephen: <em>Leechcraft</em> (for some archaeological discussions of Scandinavian forts and brewing).</li>\n</ul>\n','2014-01-25 05:55:26'),(323,112,'<p>In a nutshell, most beer judging is based on how well the beer represents the style category that it is entered into. </p>\n\n<p>These aspects of the beer are evaluated to see if they match with what is expected for the style:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>appearance: color / foam / clarity</li>\n<li>aroma: malt / hop / yeast / esters</li>\n<li>mouthfeel: body / carbonation</li>\n<li>flavor: lots here - see below</li>\n<li>aftertaste: flavors and aromas that persist after the beer is swallowed</li>\n<li>overall impression: drinkability </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of these are evaluated with respect to what is expected for the style, and points assigned.

What chemical processes actually happen to constitute \"aging\" in beer?</p>\n','2014-02-02 06:36:38'),(502,112,'<p>In short, the main factors in aging is a combination of compounds breaking down and oxidation.</p>\n\n<h2>IPAs - hop aroma breakdown</h2>\n\n<p>For IPAs, it\'s the hop aromas that break down fairly quickly - the aromatic compounds are volatile and break down noticably within a short timeframe:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tom Nielsen, Sierra Nevada’s senior research analyst focused on hop\n  degradation, says that their research has shown that after about two\n  and a half to three months, hop aroma in a packaged beer, derived\n  mainly from beta acids in the hop flower, has already started to\n  diminish significantly. It’s a sentiment backed by Patrick Langlois at\n  Great Divide in Denver, brewers of notable hoppy beers including their\n  Fresh Hop Pale Ale, Titan IPA, and Hercules Double IPA. “Hops tend to\n  dissipate in three to four months, which is why that is the\n  recommended shelf life for most of our beers. \n  (<a href=\"http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/how-much-does-keeping-a-beer-cold-really-help-retain-hop-aroma.6336/\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Barley Wines - Oxidation</h2>\n\n<p>Barley wines are not hop flavor or aroma focused beers - the major hop component is bittering acids, so they don\'t suffer the same problem with aroma losses as IPAs. However, some of the bittering compounds also have a <a href=\"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0100-40422000000100019\">half-life of 1 year</a>, so clear changes are happening in that timeframe to the bitterness.</p>\n\n<p>However, the major change for a barleywine is oxidation. There is always oxygen in the beer - either small amounts introduced during packaging, or from oxidization during the mash, which is then later released into the beer. When alcohol in the beer oxidizes, it becomes ethanal (acetaldehyde) which is a main component in sherry, and gives apple or sherry-like tones, which in a big barleywine are considered positive effects of aging, if kept in check. </p>\n\n<h2>Stouts</h2>\n\n<p>Contrasting with both IPAs and barleywines, Stouts that are meant for aging are neither hop focused nor benefit much from oxidation. Oxidizing the medium roasted malts in the wort would produce cardboard flavors due to production of <a href=\"http://brewingreality.blogspot.no/2010/04/flavour-compound-of-week-trans-2.html\">trans-2-nonenal</a>. Fortunately, the highly kilned malts act as an anti-oxidant to help prevent the beer from oxidizing. What little odization does occur tends to produce port-like flavors.</p>\n\n<p>The roasty character in stout comes from large Maillard compounds. These are still poorly understood, I can\'t find research to back it up, but I would guess the roasty character mellows due to the large compounds breaking down into shorter ones. This might explain why in some stouts the dark fruit flavors become more emphasized over time (since they are shorter Maillard compounds.)</p>\n','2014-02-02 09:48:18'),(503,-1,'','2014-02-03 02:24:09'),(504,-1,'','2014-02-03 02:24:09'),(505,117,'<p>It\'s complicated.  I think you have to look at these laws as an intersection of the practical and the cultural.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s look at two different distinctions you make.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Home Production</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn\'t always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.</p>\n\n<p>A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.</p>\n\n<p>Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don\'t believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.</p>\n\n<p>Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.</p>\n\n<p>In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component.</p>\n','2014-02-03 08:57:40'),(506,352,'<p>I recently got a \"Gnarly Oak\" craft brew package.

However, Gnarly Oak says that their Winter Bock has an OG of 15, which is likely in degrees Plato.  I leave it to other answers to thoroughly explain what that is.</p>\n\n<p>The density, of course, is increased by the sugar and other \"good stuff\" that makes beer, well, beer.  After the yeast has eaten the sugar and produced alcohol, you can measure the final gravity.  What makes this interesting is that if you have the OG and the FG, you can calculate your alcohol by volume with a <a href=\"http://wiki.homebrewersassociation.org/specificgravitymeasurements\" rel=\"nofollow\">little math</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am completely unfamiliar with RDF, however.</p>\n','2014-02-03 18:44:47'),(509,80,'<p>I\'ll answer one half and leave the other half to someone else.</p>\n\n<h2>OG is “Original Gravity”</h2>\n\n<p>Specific Gravity (often shorted to just ‘gravity’) is a measure of the density of a liquid.  Since its is mostly water, you can compare beer’s density to water to find out how much other stuff is in it.  Water has a gravity of 1.000, and beers will often have an original gravity of 1.200 to 1.020.</p>\n\n<p>“Original Gravity” is the density of beer before it’s fermented (when it’s called ‘wort’), and “Final Gravity” is the density after it’s fermented.  You can determine the alcohol content of a beer by comparing the two gravities and inferring how much fermentable “stuff” disappeared during fermentation (i.e., was converted to alcohol and CO2).</p>\n\n<p>In commercial beer, you can use OG as a shorthand for how “Big” the beer is because it indicates how much malt and other fermentable stuff was in it.  So a lighter-flavored beer like a blonde or a pilnser will often have a low original gravity (1.020 to 1.050, for example), whereas a big stout or barelywine might have a higher original gravity (1.080 up to as much as 1.200).</p>\n\n<p>OG is in important measurement for home brewers, so another use of it on a commercial beer is to help people produce clones of said beer at home by reproducing the OG (among other factors).</p>\n\n<h3>Definition</h3>\n\n<p>To get a little more technical, Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one liquid to another.  In brewing, we always use water.  So, the density of water divided by the density of water is 1.000.  The density of beer divided by the density of water is what we refer to as ‘gravity’ when discussing beer.  And since it’s a ratio of two identical measures, there are no units.  It’s not 1.000 somethings; it’s just 1.000.</p>\n\n<h3>Plato</h3>\n\n<p>Homebrewers often use \"brewer\'s points\" (eg 1.123), but you\'ll sometimes see the \"Plato Scale\", which is more popular in central Europe.  A good approximation is that 1˚ plato = 4 brewer\'s points.  So 12˚ Plato corresponds to a gravity of 1.048.</p>\n','2014-02-03 18:57:24'),(510,112,'<p>From the figures you posted,</p>\n\n<p>OG - \"Original Gravity\". When measured with a hydrometer, it measures the density relative to water. E.g. 1.010 is 1% heavier than water. The units here are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Strength\" rel=\"nofollow\">degrees Plato</a> (&deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars. Here, 15 means 15% dissolved sugar. This means the beer (or more correctly, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort\" rel=\"nofollow\">wort</a>) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.</p>\n\n<p>RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol\" rel=\"nofollow\">SG. 0.789</a>) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented. This tells you the how much of the original sugar was fermented (as a percentage). </p>\n\n<p>So, what does this mean in practice?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Winter Bock - 15 OG, 62.5 RDF - light, tasty, ever so slightly bitter</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has an average RDF for a beer that size, so it will be somewhat malty, but not cloying.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hazelnut Dark - 15 OG, 60.4 RDF - nice bitter red with slightly sweet aftertaste</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has more dissolved sugars in it compared to the Bock, so you\'d expect it to be a thicker mouthfeel and slightly more sweet, although you may not taste the sweetness if it\'s offset by roasted malts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chocolate Stout - 14.8 OG, 66.8 RDF - very sweet with hints of chocolate and malt</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Being the driest of all the beers, yet the taste description is given as very sweet. This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn\'t tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar.

Rye is a versatile ingredient, which has become increasingly popular recently with craft brewers, so there is no longer a common theme underlying rye beers, other than the rye itself. In fact, even the rye can vary. New malts are appearing, such as <a href=\"http://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=29\">crystal rye</a> which give a new flavor dimension to beers - crystal rye provides some of the spiciness of malted rye with dark fruits, and a pleasant dryness in the finish.

I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes different, with a different texture).

It is benefical if a beer is 8-10 percent or stronger, since an elevated alcohol profile will typically become smoother, mellower and more agreeable.

The Belgian pale ale receives a dose of Brettanomyces yeast as it goes in the bottle. The yeast can live in the bottle for years, slowly consuming sugars and protecting the beer’s existing flavors by consuming oxygen. Over time it goes from being bright and hoppy to bready, earthy and spicy. But sometimes they are unstable, because the yeast rapidly works through a beer and alters its character.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>What not to age:</em> IPA do not improve with age.

Canned/bottled beer has a shelf life of roughly 45-60 days, whereas a keg is only 25-40 days <strong><sup><a href=\"http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/how-long-keg-beer-remain-fresh-aid-44.html\">1</a></sup></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This means that worst case scenario for comparison you could be tasting a 2 month old canned beer versus a 3 week old draft. It can cause a difference in taste, there is a \"freshness date\" after all.

Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). </p>\n\n<p>An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant <strong><sup><a href=\"http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html\">2</a></sup></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.</p>\n\n<p>From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning.

This is because, unlike the vast majority of wine, beer is carbonated (albeit to varying degrees). When you swallow beer, some of the carbonation escapes the liquid as gas, and actually rises up from your throat into your nose (or, at least, into your nasal passages), carrying with it some of the flavor molecules of the beer.

It is highly present yet it still tastes like a beer with a good degree of hop profile. Each batch is tested by the brewery before bottling and random batches are tested externally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An alcohol content of 67.5% is not something I would associate with beer. So, why is this considered one and not a spirit?</p>\n\n<p>Dictionary.com <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Beer\">defines</a> beer as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>an alcoholic beverage made by brewing and fermentation from cereals, usually malted barley, and flavored with hops and the like for a slightly bitter taste.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not a very restrictive definition and would seem to also apply to whisky if you add some hops to it. So, is there a better one? </p>\n','2014-02-11 03:15:05'),(591,94,'<p>Snake Venom is beer not a spirit because spirits are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation\" rel=\"nofollow\">distilled</a>. Beer is technically not distilled. </p>\n\n<p>As the definition you cited says, beer is the product of fermenting sugar derived from cereal grain which is dissolved in water. So water + grain + yeast = beer. The grain has to undergo a saccharification process where the carbohydrate chains (starches) in the grain are transformed into sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose...) which is then converted into alcohol by yeast. Fermentable sugar is extracted from barley through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt\" rel=\"nofollow\">malting</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_%28beer%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">mashing</a>. The yeast is generally added to the <em>wort</em> (unfermented sugary water) manually by the brewer or wild yeast can fall into the beer from the air. </p>\n\n<p>Other processes may be involved with fermenting other grains. For example, in sake brewing, <a href=\"http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/05/making-koji-for-sake.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">koji</a> (a type of mold) is grown on rice (and soybeans) before fermentation in order to convert starches into fermentable sugars, as rice does not contain the enzymes needed to convert its starches into sugars (note: sake is generally not consider beer, but there are beers made with significant quantities of rice, up to 100% rice beer is possible).</p>\n\n<p>Hops is not a necessary ingredient in beer, and beer was made for thousands of years before people started adding hops to it. </p>\n\n<p>These strong beers like Snake Venom are generally brewed to this high ABV level through freeze \"distillation.\" This isn\'t really distillation, because no heat is involved, so people still call them beers. But this is a concentration process similar to distillation. Alcohol has a lower freezing point than water, so when you freeze beer, you can remove the ice and you\'re left with a more concentrated beer. This is the process used in the German eisbock style. The brewers also start with a high ABV beer, using special ingredients (sugar sources other than malt, like table sugar) along with strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol and still continue to live and ferment. This process can be somewhat difficult and expensive, so it gets attention. In my opinion it\'s a novelty, but I guess people like it, because they sell a lot of it.</p>\n','2014-02-11 04:07:45'),(592,-1,'','2014-02-11 08:17:57'),(593,170,'Finings are substances used towards the end of the brewing process to clarify beer or wine.

Generous spicy, peppery,\n  sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus\n  fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana\n  character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop\n  character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in\n  intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is\n  light. No diacetyl.</p>\n  \n  <p>Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.\n  Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in\n  characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.</p>\n  \n  <p>Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a\n  soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.\n  Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes\n  lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.\n  Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.\n  Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop\n  bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and\n  bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No\n  diacetyl.</p>\n  \n  <p>Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the\n  substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high\n  carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but\n  little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy\n  character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.</p>\n  \n  <p>Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but\n  slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded\n  malt flavor but should not be sweet.</p>\n  \n  <p>Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The\n  best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and\n  attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the\n  perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30\n  IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented\n  in the bottle”).</p>\n  \n  <p>History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at\n  Westmalle.</p>\n  \n  <p>Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of\n  this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white\n  sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast\n  strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics\n  and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation\n  temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if\n  used, should not be recognizable as such.

Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>To answer your question:</strong>  Mulled beer <strong>is</strong> heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn\'t <em>need</em> to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     </p>\n\n<p>As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.

Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won\'t notice the difference with bottled or canned beer.</p>\n\n<p>I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won\'t last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.</p>\n\n<p>In all of this, I am referring to room temperature.

I looked up Stella Artois\' production figures (and not because it\'s Belgian—it was just the first popular, global beer to come to mind), and found that in 2012 they produced a little over 10,000,000 hectoliters that year. Divide that by Chimay\'s 120,000 hectoliters per annum. Can I believe that 83 units of Stella are being consumed for every 1 equivalent unit of Chimay?

Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn\'t hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn\'t confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to \"sessionize\" and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: <a href=\"http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20\">http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20</a>  I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that\'s more like a carbonated lemonade than what we\'d think of as soda.</p>\n\n<p>Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.</p>\n\n<p>As to their reputation, if you\'ll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel\'s and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn\'t ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren\'t even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they\'ll become more accepted.</p>\n\n<p>That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer.</p>\n','2014-03-27 19:47:31'),(697,412,'<p>White beer (\"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_beer#Witbier\">witbier</a>\" in Dutch) is a typical Dutch/Belgian thing, from research I found that it\'s wheat bear with flavours.

So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there\'s very little change required.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.</p>\n\n<p>Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00026Z4PS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"this one\">this one</a>, are pretty cheap.</p>\n\n<p>You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you haven\'t disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.</p>\n\n<p>Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.</p>\n','2014-05-01 12:40:35'),(765,268,'<p>I feel like this is a pretty opinion based question, especially with IPAs being so \"in\" right now.  Ignoring the taste of hoppiness, which is different from bitterness (dear Bob that myth needs to die), there\'s a limit to how much bitterness we humans can actually perceive.  Past about 100 IBUs the tongue straight up can\'t tell that there are any more.  Now we perceive the quality of bitterness differently.</p>\n\n<p>So bitterness in beer is provided primarily by adding hops and boiling them for a long time.  The length of time and pH of the wort affects a chemical reaction called \"Isomerization\", which is the process by which Alpha Acids in hop oils become Iso-Alpha Acids which stay stably in solution and make beer taste bitter.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there are also Beta Acids.  Generally these are in 1:1 ratio with the Alpha acids but sometimes there are more or less depending on the hop types.</p>\n\n<p>Beta Acids are chemically Lupulones and Alpha Acids are Humulones.  We\'ve identified 3 types of each as well: No prefix, Co-, and Ad-.  Most homebrewing hop packets list total alpha acid %, then % of those acids that are Cohumulone.  But straight IBUs don\'t take which acids were used to get to that number.</p>\n\n<p>Humulone is thought to give the best, smoothest, most pleasing bitterness.  Cohumulone can be pretty abrasive, and the bitterness may seem rougher or more astringent...or just more bitter, even at the same IBUs.  Beta acids are also thought of as a \"rough\" bitterness, but they primarily produce bitterness via oxidation and can help long term shelf-stability.</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t know what all this really helps to answer, but I guess the main points are that you can\'t taste past 100 IBUs, but there are qualities to bitterness that can make some beers more abusive than others.  Also my final point is that hop flavor and aroma don\'t make a beer bitter.  If the hops have been boiled enough to actually make a beer that bitter...you do not taste those hops.  You can have hoppy beers that are smooth and not bitter at all by hop selection, yeast selection, dry hopping, and not boiling them hops very much.  You can also make beer more bitter by yeast selection and certain grains.  You can also make Ruination or Palate Wrecker, but the point is that hoppiness and bitterness are not the same thing.</p>\n','2014-05-01 13:37:07'),(766,842,'<p>Using the BeerAdvocate web site could be very helpful.

(Assuming it isn\'t <em>too</em> great, that is.  Beer in a bottle or can, for instance, is definitely at a disadvantage.) </p>\n\n<p>I\'d like to also look at a few of the reasons they state in their marketing material as well.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don\'t have any evidence to back this up, but I suspect that this is probably the most legitimate of the claims.  This would have a significant effect on the experience of drinking the beer, it is going to be specific to their recipe, and it\'s a reason that\'s often given for custom beer glassware.  (Boston Beer Company laser etches the bottom of their Sam Adams Boston Lager glass to enhance cavitation, for instance.) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no idea what this means.  Alchemy is the term for pre-chemistry, and primarily deals with trying to turn ordinary substances into gold.  I assume they\'re trying to insinuate that the glass magically turns Stella into better beer. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is plausible, and perhaps unfortunate.  This is why you are supposed to hold red wine glasses by the bowl (to warm the wine) and white wine glasses by the stem (to keep it cool.)   However, with wine, a serving is generally five ounces or so, compared to twelve or more of lager.   The effect certainly won\'t be the same given the significantly higher mass.   The unfortunate bit is that colder is not generally what you want when you\'re talking about good beer.  Colder is the realm of the cheap macro-brews like Coors Light.   Cold subdues flavor compounds, which is useful when the flavor of the beer is nasty, and not so useful when it\'s pleasant.  This certainly isn\'t a a requirement or general best practice for lagers as you won\'t find stemmed glassware used for Boston Beer\'s Samuel Adams Lager glass: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMcwF.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel Adams Boston Lager Glass\"> </p>\n\n<p>or my classic Spiegelau Lager glass: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wn6wv.png\" alt=\"Speieglau lager glass\"></p>\n\n<p>or any of the glasses you\'ll see used for the many fine Lagers of Germany.  So, I have to suppose one of the following two reasons.  First, they may simply be pandering to the general belief that colder beer is better.  Second, it would be unfortunate if they were trying to hide a lack of quality by trying to ensure the beer was too cold to taste properly.  </p>\n\n<p>Finally, and I\'ve left this to last, because it\'s purely my opinion...I think they\'ve chosen the chalice glass specifically because it\'s fancy, and that\'s the image they want to portray for their beer.  When people see the Stella glass, they don\'t want their beer to be lumped in with the pint-glass styles, they want it to stand out as sophisticated, and the chalice specifically gives it that cachet.   </p>\n\n<p>So, my top line and bottom line are down to marketing, with a bit of truth and a bit of fiction to all the bits in between. </p>\n','2014-05-21 01:20:03'),(799,905,'<p>It is quite simple.\nBeer is made off starch (read: the alcohol)\nand Wines are made from fruit\'s sugar (fructose and glucose).</p>\n','2014-05-21 09:11:44'),(800,112,'<p>I think the main difference is that beer is brewed - you have to steep the grain in water.

In London (UK) we have a brewery producing a 2.8% abv beer (Redemption brewery, beer name escapes me) which is packed with hops and of greater hop depth than many IPAs. Batches of a beer that are brewed to be low alcohol will necessarily be different to those brewed at full strength which is why I would hope (pray?) that any brewer whose product is worth drinking would make a different beer, brewed at low strength for these markets. These beers can be as flavoursome and exciting as, if not more so than, higher strength beers.\nThe process to make the beer lower ABV is simply reducing the amount of sugar that can be converted into alcohol by using a lower sugar content mash either using specific lower sugar malts, using less malt, or using a yeast that will not support higher alcohol concentrations (alcohol kills yeast...!). Using less yeast won\'t work as the given yeast will continue to multiply to make up the shortfall. If you are not making real beer halting the fermentation early by killing the yeast with heat (or similar) will produce a lower alcohol beer but it will be sweeter as there is more unfermented sugar. Fining and serving real ale before fermentation has produced a higher strength may have a similar effect for those types of beer.\nSince alcohol dissolves flavouring compounds better than water it is much harder to brew a highly flavoured weak beer <em>but</em> this may be offset by taste complexity.\nLarger breweries will reduce alcohol levels chemically post-production by boiling off alcohol or similar. this will reduce the flavouring compounds in the beer (see GCSE fractional distillation notes or similar for details) and so make the beer taste weaker.

Assuming you are referring to Becks Premium Lager (as opposed to one of their other offerings), Becks has an IBU (International Bitterness Units) of 20 where Heineken has 23 IBUs.  Based on IBUs, Heineken should be more bitter but not by much.  What you\'re tasting could be accounted for by batch to batch variation on behalf of the brewer or the conditions that the bottles were stored (length of storage, lighting, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the bitterness in most of Becks\' beers come from the use of darker malts, while the majority of the bitterness in Heineken comes from the use of (pellet) hops. \nThis makes the bitterness in Becks tend towards roastier flavors, and the bitterness in Heineken to tend to be more herbaceous or floral. It is possible that you are more personally sensitive to one set of those flavor compounds.</p>\n\n<p>Note that IBUs are an imperfect measurement of bitterness so only consider it as an approximation.

You can have a beer with a larger number of IBUs but also a large amount of residual sweetness such as caramel malts) and this will generally taste sweeter than a beer that has a lower IBUs and almost no residual sweetness.</p>\n\n<p>Each brewer designs a beer with a taste profile in mind, and then seeks ingredients and sometimes process changes to arrive at this desired flavor profile. This often requires several iterations until the desired result is reached, and even then it may not be possible to reach it every time, so the brewer may also choose to blend beers from different batches to arrive close to the desired result. The same is true for Heineken - their Quality Assurance team will have been given clear guidelines on the spec for the beer, both as hard and fast measurable, objective facts (IBUs, Color, carbonation, diacetyl, fusel alcohols, esters etc...) and also as subjective - how it tastes. </p>\n\n<p>So the final answer about why one beer is more bitter than another is because their respective breweries have decided that\'s the flavor they want, and they have crafted a brew to produce their chosen flavor profile.</p>\n','2014-06-03 16:20:41'),(845,961,'<p>Pretty much this.

Anyways, I really liked the Becks, so I\'d like to know what I\'m drinking and why I like it. Also what are other similar beers to Becks?</p>\n','2014-06-27 03:18:40'),(890,268,'<p>Beck\'s is a pale German pilsner brewed by Beck\'s Brewery headquartered in Bremen.  The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck\'s is wholly owned by AB InBev.</p>\n\n<p>Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.</p>\n\n<p>Most \"macrobrews\" will be somewhat similar, though the stock \"American\" variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck\'s claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.</p>\n\n<p>St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck\'s.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it\'s a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it\'s in the Pilsner style so while it\'s still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.</p>\n\n<p>If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone\'s Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you\'re near MA at all) should be similar.  According to <a href=\"http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/6/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this list</a> on BeerAdvocate you should be near Berghoff and Baderbrau which will both make traditional German styles.  Some breweries, Baderbrau included, will call their pale lager a \"Lawnmower beer\".</p>\n\n<p>Branching out, Sam Adams Boston Lager is a style called Vienna Lager which may also appeal you.  Though it will be significantly maltier than Beck\'s.  Anything with Dortmunder in the name will also be similar, though hoppier but not like an American Pale Ale or IPA or anything.  You might also be interested in any brewery\'s Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch\'s are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.</p>\n\n<p>Does that help?</p>\n','2014-06-27 14:12:37'),(892,1039,'<p>I would suggest Heritage Brewing (<a href=\"http://www.heritagebrewing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link</a>) in Manassas, VA.

These two operate under the wing of the two \"large\" local breweries (Egils and Víking), serving as their respective experimental departments. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Borg keeps up a steady stream of new beers each year, easily Iceland\'s most \"prolific publisher\".

Segull 67 is the newest and by far the smallest operating brewery. They released one beer in 2015, a dark lager.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the time of writing, this list is exhaustive for operational breweries. In addition, I know of three breweries which will be opening \"any day now\": Hún/Hann brugghús (in Reykjavík), Austri (in the eastern part of the country) and Hið austfirska bruggfélag (also in the eastern part of the country).</p>\n\n<h2>Brewpubs</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to the breweries that sell nation-wide, there are a few who focus on their own premises.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bryggjan Brugghús, in Reykjavík near the harbor area.

It is notable for its diverse and rapidly rotating taps. At any given time, about half of them are likely to  be connected to local beers. The bar is independent, but beers from Borg brewery are always prominent in their choices. </li>\n<li>Bjórgarðurinn, in Reykjavík. They have 22 taps, Icelandic craft beers always among them. They serve food other than bar snacks, mostly gourmet sausages that they recommend pairing with particular beers. It is a hotel bar, not associated with a brewery.</li>\n<li>Kaldi Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is not owned by Bruggsmiðjan, but it brands itself as a place where you can get local beer, in particular, Bruggsmiðjan\'s Kaldi. This is, however, not a place I would call a <em>craft bar</em> that prides itself on a varied selection.</li>\n<li>R5 Micro Bar, in Akureyri. I have not visited, but it\'s marketing itself as a craft beer bar. The locals seem impressed!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Micro/Craft beer fans will also want to know of Mikkeller &amp; Friends Reykjavík. Large tap selection there, but no focus on local produce.</p>\n\n<p>Borg and Einstök taps can commonly be found interspersed with the common Egils and Víking taps. Steðji and Ölvisholt beers are only sporadically found on taps.</p>\n\n<p>Many other bars (but <em>definitely</em> not all) have some ambition when it comes to craft beer availability without making a particular deal of it. Hlemmur Square, a hostel/bar near the main bus station, is usually particularly well stocked. But always, ask your bartender!</p>\n\n<h2>Selected products</h2>\n\n<p>Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything <em>quite</em> like them abroad.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.</li>\n<li>Lava. A smoked imperial stout.</li>\n<li>Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And always, keep an eye out for seasonal beers. The breweries usually allow themselves more creative freedom on those products. In 2014, we saw beers like the Einstök Arctic Berry Ale (beer flavored with Icelandic berries), Fenrir (an IPA smoked with sheep dung) and Hvalur (the whale beer mentioned earlier).</p>\n\n<h2>General beer buying advisory</h2>\n\n<p>You <strong>won\'t</strong> buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket.

Comparatively, real ales I\'ve tried have a bland, waxy taste to them, unlike craft beers such as Brewdog\'s Punk IPA, Dead Pony Club, and 5AM Saint.</p>\n\n<p>A friend expressed to me his view that the terms “craft beer” and “real ale” are synonymous, stating: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“You realise that most of the industrialised breweries started out making “craft beer,” however demand and greed caused them to skimp on ingredients, adding less and less to make more and more profit?

I am somewhat aware of the evolution of the UK brewing industry, but nowhere near as knowledgeable as I am about America\'s.</p>\n\n<p>Now, definitions.  Craft Beer commonly derives the Brewer\'s Association definition of a Craft Brewer.  Which is Small, Independent, Traditional.  Sparing the specifics it\'s a definition meant to exclude the world\'s largest brewing companies, and their \"crafty\" portfolios.  \"Crafty\" is a pejorative used to describe brands or brewers which may or may not produce good tasting beer, but are owned by the larger brands in attempts to diversify their portfolios.  While the BA is primarily focused on the American market, it seems most European writers defer to their terms.</p>\n\n<p>Real Ale, is a distinctly British term.  Coined by CAMRA in the 70\'s it\'s more to do with the packaging and serving of the beer in the pub than the business scale of the brewer.  All Real Ale has to do is be cask conditioned and served via a gravity tap or hand-pulled with a beer engine.  This excludes a majority of what we in the US would consider craft beer, because it excludes anything kegged, filtered, force carbonated, or pushed with pressurized gas.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to an interesting overlap where an unfiltered beer, carbonated by natural fermentation, could NOT be a real ale because it was kegged and served on gas.  Also, nothing prevents a large brand like Murphy\'s or Beamish (both owned by Heineken) from marketing a \"Real Ale\".</p>\n\n<p>These definitions aside: It sounds like you may just be an IPA fan.  Your craft beer list is entirely IPAs.  It\'s not really accurate to conflate Craft and IPAs because plenty of craft beers are stouts, rye beers, Scotch ales, English bitters, or totally non-traditional things.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue you might have with \"Real Ale\" is a technical note.  Because it\'s exposed to oxygen as soon as the cask is tapped real ale tends to spoil if it\'s not drank quickly.  The characteristic tastes of oxidized beer are cardboard, and the characteristic tastes of beer left on dead yeast for way too long is soapy.  I can easily see that coming off as \"waxy\", especially if it\'s warmer than you\'re used to drinking and you\'ve just downed some IPAs.</p>\n\n<p>Beer today is probably the best its ever tasted because of refinements in production techniques and farming.  Consumers are becoming interested in what their beer is made of so the quality of ingredients and care on a whole is improving.  But real ale is a niche,  there are going to be great traditional brewers making phenomenal beer, but it\'s prone to spoilage if not treated well.  There may also be those using it as a marketing gimmick.</p>\n\n<p>And finally a last point about industrialization:  It has vastly improved the quality of ingredient and process that all brewers use.  The huge brands we now have, all started off as craft at one point.  But if they are no longer craft they either couldn\'t weather the market and faced the choice of no longer being a company or selling to a business and risk becoming more about business than beer.  In the US we have large breweries proving you can still be pretty big and make good beer.  Sam Adams, Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head, Yuengling, are HUGE by craft standards and haven\'t compromised the quality of their ingredients because brewers are still in charge.  Industrialization will never prevent a brewery lead by a passionate brewer from making interesting beer, but leaving brewing decisions up to a business man will always making boring beer.</p>\n','2014-10-17 14:30:48'),(1053,1404,'<p>Is there a ranking of beers (maybe by country) you can actually find in a supermarket?</p>\n\n<p>I know the BeerAdvocate one, but it seems I would need to sell my soul to get any beer in the top 250.</p>\n','2014-10-19 18:34:00'),(1054,1385,'<p>Drinking beer alone does not cause you to get a big belly, it\'s the amount food that goes along with it.

It\'s a very bland beer that\'s stored on American bourbon casks for a while. This gives it a strong, perfumy vanilla aroma. Some people think it feels artificial, but it\'s really not. It\'s the aroma of the American oak. Given that your friend loves vanilla it seems the obvious place to start.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Duchesse du Bourgogne</strong> is technically a Flemish red. It\'s a sweetish beer that\'s been stored in wooden barrels so that it turns a little acidic, too. Kind of fruity, kind of vinous, little bitterness. It\'s really a classic beer, and while many men love it (me among them), even more women seem to like it. Really worth trying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>German weissbier</strong> is sweetish, not sour, not at all bitter, and has a gentle banana flavour that comes from the yeast. Again it\'s something that many men like, and more women. Good examples are Weihenstephaner, Paulaner, and Erdinger (in that order). US wheat ale might work, too, but they generally use normal ale yeast and thus turn deathly boring.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Belgian witbier</strong> is similar to the weissbier, even though it uses a more neutral yeast, but then makes up for it with orange peel and coriander. Hoegaarden is the original, but there are many more examples you could try.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Belgian beer</strong> in general is sweet and low on bitterness. Some good ones to try: Westmalle Trippel, Barbar, Chimay White, La Trappe (legally Dutch), Rochefort, St Bernardus.

There\'s been big debates over to what degree they were aware that water caused diseases while beer did not, but a big factor was that beer was seen as nourishing (which it is) while water was not. In an age where getting enough to eat was a recurring challenge, this contributed to making people prefer beer/wine. In practice it seems people preferred alcoholic drinks for both reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, people would drink small beer as an everyday drink against thirst (and that\'s what children got, too), and beer proper for celebrations. That\'s actually a Finnish saying: \"small beer for work, beer for celebration\" (\"Kaljalla työt tehdään, oluella pidot pidetään\").</p>\n\n<p>Small beer was generally made together with beer. That is, they\'d do a mash, and the first wort that\'s run off has the most sugar. As you keep pouring water through, obviously more and more sugar is washed out of the malts, and the wort keeps getting waterier. Eventually they\'d stop, and make beer from the wort. Then they\'d continue, and run off a much weaker wort from the remaining sugar in the malts. This was the small beer. Many places they would even do a third beer, which was so weak it would barely ferment. There were also other grain-based drinks, made from flour or bread, and typically sour and just barely alcoholic. Kvass is the best-known example, but there were many others.</p>\n\n<p>Weak beer as an every-day drink continued for much longer than you might think. It was the introduction of tea/coffee that first started displacing it. Then, later, higher availability of milk, then juices and soft drinks continued the process.

For whatever reason beer marketers greatly prefer the term \"amber\" over \"red\" when referring to lagers, while using \"red\" over \"amber\" when referring to ales eg Red IPA). These are lagers with a slightly sweeter profile than the \"standard International pilsner\" style churned out by every macrobrewery, due to the addition of Vienna, crystal, and/or caramel malts. Indeed, when looking at the  examples you gave on Rate Beer and Beer Advocate, RB considers both to be of the \"Amber Lager/Vienna\" style, while BA considers Dos Equis to be a Vienna Lager and Yuengling to be an \"American Amber/Red Lager\". What\'s the difference? Generally, the \"American\" prefix at the start of any beer style means that it\'s hoppier, due to our lovefest with hops (at least compared to the Old World). Also, RB doesn\'t break amber lagers into American and not varieties.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/amber-lager-vienna/36/\" rel=\"nofollow\">category page on Ratebeer</a> or <a href=\"http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/30/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beer Advocate</a> to browse through more examples of the style.

For some great examples of Vienna/Amber Lagers you might be able to find, Sam Adams Boston Lager is rated #44 on RB and #3 on Beer Advocate (why the big discrepancy? RB users tend to be more heavily biased by the idea that certain breweries aren\'t \"cool\", while BA users tend to be more objective).</p>\n\n<p>There is always the BJCP guide, which makes the rules that guide most homebrewing and professional contests such as the GABF. The GABF can have real reputation and financial influence for a brewery, so it requires very precise definitions, but outside of competitions most of the brewing world takes the BJCP with a grain of salt (or is it a grain of barley?).

As this changed the palettes of many at that time they also introduced a great amount of fresh hops to these new ales to make a strongly hopped ale.

In some areas where corked bottles were traditionally used for bottling it was easier to get champagne bottles or similar bottles that could support carbonation and corking became a matter of convenience as it was cheaper to source bottles locally. However, now it is just a matter of marketing the product. All other corked bottles went into large format, corked bottles to make them look like a classier product than a six pack and legitimize higher prices in the customers\' eyes.

A lot of the reason for carbonation is to preserve the beer. By replacing the oxygen in the keg the beer will last longer. Now we associate the carbonation with beer but that was not always there traditionally. While it is true that older beer bottled from barrel storage was carbonated during bottling it wasn\'t mentioned that historically beer was poured from the cask and therefore not carbonated beyond natural carbonation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Cask</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this string cask beer wasn\'t mentioned but it is literally from the barrel. It is the smoothest and creamiest way to \"tap\" beer. It\'s also considered the best by many purists. It however has a huge limitation in modern applications. The barrels don\'t last as long and thereby need to be smaller, swapped out more often, and potentially wasted if not used quick enough. For this reason most businesses opt for the larger, easier, cheaper carbonated kegs. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Purists</strong></p>\n\n<p>As stated before by Jeffrey Lin the Nitro is a newer solution but I have to take exception to his explanation of the unnatural side of Nitro. Really the purists are fine with nitro. They may not be particularly fond of the \"in-can\" nitro widget, but really the process just replaces a larger CO2 bubble with the smaller finer bubbles of dissolved nitrogen and thereby some dissolved C02 as well. Purists truly would be more likely to enjoy a cask pour but as Nitro, in a lot of ways, is closer to cask both in consistency and the \"creaminess\" described it goes without saying this would be enjoyed by the purists as well. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Types of Beer for Nitro</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are many types of beer where smooth finer bubbles are appropriate. Guinness being only one that comes to mind but really most British milds. Also English ales, pales and creams just to mention a few. The older styles from England were flat compared to American lagers and most modern beers. Another good example is a Boddingtons. Finer bubbles fit the mold with anything that traditionally would be served from the cask. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>\n\n<p>As with most new technology it serves a purpose and in this case the purpose is two-fold. Store without oxygen to prevent going bad, and keep with the original intended style of those types of beers. The discussion of flavor change is slightly off because flavor change would only be present if oxygen were allowed to be present in the beer when kegged. Texture change is more accurate and the nitro is an effort to more closely approximate that. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hope that is helpful to fill in some details and thanks to Sloloem for helping, hopefully it is more easily digestable/readable?

Some of these are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Warm beer foams too much. If your server is dumping tons of head down the drain to fill your glass with enough beer, it might be too warm.</li>\n<li>Too much pressure in the keg makes beer foam too much.  The brewer carbonated it to the level they wanted, the bar might be over-carbonating it.</li>\n<li>Cold beer does not foam very much.  If the kegs are chilled too cold or the bar is serving beer in a frozen glass, your beer is probably too cold.  Cold temperatures will dull flavors and kill aromas. Obviously if you\'re into beer for flavor, this is bad.</li>\n<li>Dirty glasses tend to dissipate the foam very quickly, so you could be drinking whatever was in the glass before, or soap scum... neither of which sounds very tasty.</li>\n<li>Under-carbonated beer doesn\'t foam very much.  Under-carbonation can also dull flavors since so much of taste is based on smell and you can\'t smell volatile aromatics if there\'s no fizz to carry them out of the liquid.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are various schools of thought on the head as an indicator of beer\'s quality or freshness but realistically this will vary by style.

While they\'re both styles of dark beer nowadays Mild is very low ABV with a lot of malty/nutty flavors and fruity sweetness.  Stouts are stronger than milds with no fruitiness and a lot of roasted and burnt flavors instead of malts.  Most will probably be more bitter and have less residual sweetness than milds.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The long answer is:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Historically stout and mild were completely unrelated terms that referred to completely different things than they wound up being known for.  Both started being used in the 18th century.  Stout originally just meant strong and Mild was used as the opposite of Keeping (or Stale), which basically just meant the beer was fresh rather than being aged in a barrel for any length of time.</p>\n\n<p>Mild turned into a strength descriptor in the early 19th century when brewers started using the X, XX, XXX system to classify their ales, which referred to both the ABV and pounds of hops per barrel.  But Mild was still a pale beer.  As the 20th century progressed Milds started becoming more amber colored and playing more as malty and sweet.</p>\n\n<p>All beers until this point were actually much stronger than we\'re used to today.  Barclay Perkins X Ale in 1839 was actually close to 8% ABV.</p>\n\n<p>Grain shortages and government restrictions towards the end of WWI dropped Mild to close to 2%, and brewers also added dark sugars and mixed in amber and brown malt to keep some measure of flavor.  After the war ended ABVs bounced back up but new taxes in the 30s pushed them back down, close to the modern range for Mild.  Dark mild being the standard and Pale mild being a variant didn\'t really happen until the 1950s.</p>\n\n<p>The history of stout is quite a bit muddier, though the general consensus seems to be that it evolved out of Stout Brown Porter and has been largely interchangeable with Porter for most of its history.  </p>\n\n<p>The differentiation probably started with in the invention of Black Patent Malt in 1817.  In the late 1700s new technology had been invented that allowed brewers to track their efficiency and they realized the roasty brown malt they used for porters was really expensive compared to how much fermentable sugar it produced. So they started making porters out of mostly pale malt with brown malt and burnt sugars among other ingredients for color and flavor.  </p>\n\n<p>Britain had banned the use of anything besides malted barley in brewing in 1816 which really kindof screwed porter brewers over.  With Black Patent they had something which was absurdly dark enough that they could finally make up the color difference using pale malt.  Though most brewers in England continued to use some portion of brown malt, brewers in Ireland switched completely to pale and black malts only.  Irish beer was also less hoppy than English beer in general since hops didn\'t grow as well in Ireland.</p>\n\n<p>Guinness renamed its XX Porter to Extra Stout Porter in ~1820 and the popularity and marketing gradually dropped \"Porter\" from the name, which is probably where Stout began to evolve as a style separate from Porter.  But it\'s in a bit of grey area, people in 2015 are still debating Porter vs Stout.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short version of the long story</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mild originally just meant Fresh and as a style evolved from the weakest pale beer a brewery made, and only really became what we think of it as today in the last 60 years.  Stout originally just meant Strong and was a synonym for Porter for a very long time until marketing tried to differentiate it maybe 150 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry about the wall, but I fell down a rabbit hole of interesting beer history.</p>\n','2015-07-13 20:39:08'),(3463,4322,'<p>Had to replace a faulty regulator for my two tap system.

Off course, although I\'m sure it is a really good beer (I\'ve never had it), all that difficulty to get it undeniably contributes to its fame.</p>\n\n<p>I find <strong><em>Rochefort 10</em></strong> (a belgian dark strong ale as <em>Westvleteren 12</em>) one of (if not the) best, certainly my very favorite on the list, but on the other end of the flavor range, <strong><em>Achel 10</em></strong> (a strong golden ale) is my favorite blonde/pale trappist as well.</p>\n\n<p><em>La Trappe</em>, which is the biggest trappist brewery, has at least twice the labels other breweries have, and is widely available on market, still has very good beers.</p>\n\n<p>So, the short answer is: trappist is not a style, and there\'s no such thing as the best one.

I know, you can find hundreds of different bugs in a single lambic, but from all that, only a few really play an important role. You can see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this study here from UC Davis</a>, based on Allagash\'s Coolship.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that supports this argument is that american breweries are successfully making lambic-style beers following almost the exact same traditional process as the belgian. But, then, one thing they\'ve already learned is that one of the main factors in the early process of inoculation and fermentation is temperature, what implies year\'s season as well. Usually they leave the wort to be inoculated over night at fall. You can listen to what people from Allagash say about their <em>Coolship Ale</em>, for example.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the process, well, now it depends on infinite factors (barrels, wood, storage, temperature, etc). But, your question was about distance between places, what suggests the <em>terroir</em> aspect of the production. So, I would say (and that\'s a completely wild guess), since you\'re in a place surrounded by any vegetation, with a minimum of biodiversity, and have wind, it doesn\'t make a big deal of a difference.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and don\'t forget one thing. You get (if so) a consistent and regular flavor from those kind of beers <strong>only because people blend it</strong> before releasing, once different barrels even of the same batch turn out to be completely different one from the other.

It\'s very common with Imperial Stouts, for example, which is one of the styles that goes best with this kind of practice. Generally, boozy and dark beers are more suitable for this, but not only (people age belgian tripels, for example, which, while being sometimes boozy, aren\'t roasty at all).</p>\n\n<p>So, talking about oak, you get that vanilla, coconut, sherry flavors, sometimes some smoke from the barrel\'s inside toast, and things like that. Boozines is softened as well (mellowed). Off course, inside the barrel, a lot of complex reactions occurs, and I don\'t know how it can be compared with wine chemically, but, along with other compounds, tannins are incorporated to the beer, altough it doesn\'t always appear so much in the final product like in wines. It all depends on a series of factors, including the amount of time the liquid spends in the barrel.</p>\n\n<p>Besides it, some aeration and in consequence oxidation does occur, but that\'s not the main purpose in that \"type\" of aging. Flavors of the original barrel\'s content may be picked as well, in higher or lower levels.</p>\n\n<p>Another main use of barrels in the beer industry is for production of wild/sour beers, in that case, the micro-aeration being a main desired factor. When people want to sour their beers and/or develop wild characteristics in it, they use different organisms after the primary fermentation. In order to sour it they use bacteria and for the rustic (wild) flavors they use another kind of yeast called brettanomyces in a further step of fermentation/maturation, in which oxygen presence is fundamental, but a slow pace is mandatory as well to avoid an overgrowth of the organisms and a possible \"spoilage\" of the beer. So, the barrel is a perfect place for this process to take place, because wood allows the oxygen to get in very slowly. Besides it, the barrel itself becomes a colony house for all those bugs (as brewers call those wild microorganisms), so you may not even need to pitch any yeast/bacteria after some time anymore. Off course, the wood alone impairs some flavors to the beer as well. You end up with a very, very complex product.</p>\n\n<p>These days, people are doing all kinds of crazy experiments you can think of, and there\'s no mandatory rule when using barrels. It all depends on what result you want to achieve and real-world experience as well.

Generally speaking, we use brewer\'s yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae for ale or Sacc. Pastorianus for lager) because the other stuff tastes pretty nice, or at least doesn\'t taste bad.  Various strains of the same organism produce different byproducts, an example would be an English ale yeast which is well known for compounds that are kindof sweet or fruity vs Belgian ale yeasts which are well known for being peppery, clovy, or banana-y.  Those flavors all come from the yeast used for fermentation, but it\'s only ever a single strain of yeast, which was isolated in a lab.</p>\n\n<p>Sour beers are basically defined by not using a single isolated, clean-tasting strain of Saccharomyces.  The most common sour yeast used is in a genus called Brettanomyces, which depending on the specific species can produce flavors like...horse saddle, bandaid, cheese, cloves, and vinegar.

After the Industrial Revolution, with more hygiene and sterile tools, that characteristic became more and more uncommon, and at some point, undesirable.

It is name comes from the brewery founder Alexander Rodenbach.</p>\n\n<p>After the take-over, Palm quickly stopped the production of Rodenbach\'s Alexander beer, a cherry-flavoured beer.<a href=\"http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-000720.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Palm Explains Plans for Rodenbach Beers\">[1]</a> When Palm Brewery bought Rodenbach, another brewery it owned already made a cherry beer. At that time Alexander Rodenbach had to be ceased for contractual non-compete sorts of reasons. However, in recent years, Palm/Rodenbach has produced and distributed, first, Rodenbach foederbier, which is served only from cask, and is unfiltered and unblended. It comes straight from an oak riping barrel and is not processed further.</p>\n\n<p>I think the bartender told you to drink your Rodenbach with a shot of cherry, so that you can taste the original Rodenbach Alexander (the cherry-flavoured beer, Rodenbach\'s erstwhile cherry beer which produced before the brewery was sold to Palm). </p>\n','2015-07-24 04:14:07'),(3499,4353,'<p>I was wondering if there really is a difference in taste when you drink the same beer out of a glass, a bottle and a can.</p>\n\n<p>Can anybody please tell me if there is a difference or if this is just a prejudice in your mind that makes you think it\'s better in one way?</p>\n','2015-07-24 07:10:26'),(3500,268,'<p>Glass vs bottle or can will be a pretty noticeable difference with most styles of beer simply due to the size of the opening.  When you pour from the storage vessel to the glass you disturb the beer a lot which drives CO2 gas out, and that takes a lot of aromatics with it so the aroma you get from the beer in a glass is WAY stronger and more complex than what you\'d sniff from the bottle or can.</p>\n\n<p>Also smell is a pretty huge part of tasting something and when you drink from a glass you\'re putting your nose right into the thick of all that, so the flavor will be more intense as well.  Bottles and cans sort of keep that toned down since you don\'t smell the beer as much.</p>\n\n<p>There used to be a prejudice against cans because the liquid and the aluminum would react and oxidize, but they started coating the insides with a food safe epoxy resin decades ago and it\'s completely sealed now.  As far as taste goes there\'s no difference between the two, but cans actually store a bit better because they let in no light and no air while bottles will eventually let through enough to affect the beer.  Brewers like cans as well since they\'re more portable, don\'t shatter, chill faster, and are often cheaper to fill.</p>\n','2015-07-24 14:08:30'),(3501,4358,'<p>As far as I\'ve ever tried, old beers, even cheap light lager like Bud Light, will taste pretty off after a lot of in-bottle or can aging. The older it is, the worse it will taste, but having drunk more than one in a sitting, I can safely say it\'s no more harmful than drinking a fresh one. Never gotten sick off one, but it\'s pretty hard to down them without gagging a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Some beers actually seem to intentionally go for a similar taste. Anything with a green bottle seems to be trying for a skunky flavor, while brown bottles help filter out damaging light. Compare a Beck\'s or Heineken to, say, a Budweiser.  The former will have a distinctly skunky flavor to them, basically similar to marijuana. The latter has a bit of a rice taste, as that\'s what\'s used in the brewing process, with a slight sweetness, but overall just a bubbly light flavor.</p>\n\n<p>As Linus pointed out, there\'s going to be a \"wet cardboard\" taste with past-due light lagers. I\'m guessing this is due to the breakdown of oils and sugars in the beer, as well as other general chemical changes. I\'m not sure why it has that taste of cardboard or paper, but it\'s definitely present. After doing some research (aka looking it up on google), I found that the main culprit of that cardboard taste is a chemical called \"nonenal\". It\'s apparently also a chemical in human body odor of aged people, leading to the so-called \"old people smell\". This isn\'t proven, but there\'s some evidence that this is the main culprit for the somewhat-neutral scent of older people\'s perspiration. In a beer, not quite as neutral, however.</p>\n','2015-07-25 18:52:39'),(3502,4359,'<p>Try \"Flensburger Pilsener\", another typical Pilsener from Northern Germany. </p>\n','2015-07-26 13:35:13'),(3503,4338,'<p>Has any of you guys ever aged Fuller\'s Golden Pride?

However, if we want to play analysis, the answer would certainly be whiskey, American bourbon most likely. Let\'s go through the choices. </p>\n\n<p>1) Wine. No way. If someone is going to generically order wine, they at least specify a color, red or white. Plus wine is mostly all the same strength, only varying a couple percent either direction, unless you count fortified wines, which are another topic. </p>\n\n<p>2) Beer. Ordering a generic beer would get you a basic beer, which isn\'t very strong. Only a few specialized beer bars would have any beers that I\'d call really strong. Any beer stronger than 12% is going to be very rare, with most bars not even having above 8%. The kinds of people who order strong beers, these 8, 9, 10, etc beers, would always order by name. They are craft beer fans. These aren\'t really strong enough to help someone in distress. </p>\n\n<p>3) Vodka. Unless you are a Russian or a huge vodka fan, you don\'t order vodka straight like this. Vodka is generally for mixing in America. The people who are serious about vodka drinking would order by brand name.</p>\n\n<p>4) Gin is the same story as vodka really. Gin in generally served in mixed form, although a dry gin martini is close to 100% gin, it still counts as mixed. </p>\n\n<p>5) Cordials, liquers, etc. Again, would be ordered by type or brand, and often not that strong compared to the main liquors. </p>\n\n<p>6) Rum, can be quite strong, makes decent shots, makes decent sipping. But it conjours up images of pirate and or topical locations. If the movie is set in the Caribbean, they would mean rum. </p>\n\n<p>7) Tequila. It\'s strong, makes good shots. Not so great for sipping, unless you are talking about the really good stuff or you are a tequila fan. If you are in Mexico or a Cantina, they would mean tequila. </p>\n\n<p>8) Whiskey. This is the winning category. It\'s always strong. It tastes good in shots, and makes fine sipping from a glass. This is manly and good for all classes of life. Blue collars and white collars alike love whiskey. if you are doing, \"forget your troubles\" kinda drinking, whiskey is the best choice. If you are sad, or upset, or worried, or looking for a fight, or anything like that, whiskey is the best choice. A real American manly man is going to want whiskey, usually bourbon, something like Knob\'s Creek. Some will prefer Irish whiskeys, or Scottish Whiskys, (notice no e), but if they do, they will say so by name. </p>\n\n<p>I mean, I know if I was upset like that and going to a bar and said a stupid order like gimme a strong one, I would mean bourbon.

Therefore, each state has its own set of laws in which the brewer is responsible for knowing and abiding by. It is incumbent on you, the brewer, to know the specific regulations of each state in which you sell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It boils down to what the distributor wants to do and state-by-state requirements for what can be sold there. <a href=\"http://brewprof.com/ohio-abv-increase-bill-gaining-traction/\">Ohio has a cap on alcohol by volume of 12%.</a> <a href=\"http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=78096\">Any beer over 4% ABV in Oklahoma must be sold only at liquor stores at room temperature</a>.

There\'s also only a certain amount of time available to package. This is why there will usually be only a certain number and type of beer that gets packaged in these containers until a brewery grows to a certain size that allows better economies of scale.

Some brewers, especially home brewers, will pressurize their kegs through natural carbonation but most just push CO2 from a canister.

A hand pump, or beer engine, uses a siphon to \"pull\" the beer out of the cask and up to the tap.  The physics needs atmospheric pressure to be maintained inside the cask, so it\'s usually open to the air at the top.  This required a fast turnaround on casks to prevent the beer from spoiling, which is one of the reasons cask/\"real\" ale fell out favor.  Kegs simply kept longer and were more economical.  I think CAMRA still isn\'t a fan of them, but some bars use \"breathers\" which basically add very low pressures of CO2 to replace the volume lost by the beer, but not enough to pressurize the cask.

Ultimately sweet beers are part of the style they are in so avoiding sugary sweet beers is as simple as knowing the styles.  You can skip to the bottom if that\'s all you want to know.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of sweetness that are often discussed and sometimes confused in beer, a Malty flavor and a Sweet flavor. The same ingredients are involved but in different ways.  Sugary sweet beers basically come from unfermented sugars which simply means sugars that the yeast hasn\'t processed to create alcohol and carbon dioxide.  This is also called attenuation.  Wikipedia has a good link for this but I can only post two links at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>This can be caused by a few different things such as unfermentable sugars that come from the way the beer is mashed (when the grains are mixed in with hot water and left to sit for a specific length of time) or from specialty grains, or the yeast itself.</p>\n\n<p>The explanation of how the mash affects sweetness is very complex and full of biochemistry.  I will try to summarize.  Grains are full of starches that need to be converted to sugar for the yeast to ferment.  There are two main enzymes involved in this process, alpha and beta amylase enzymes.  Using a branched tree analogy works great.  After a strong storm you need to clean up your yard from the limbs that have fallen from the trees.  You have a lopper (alpha amylase) which is great for cutting the branches apart from the limbs but still leave you with long branches and twigs.  You also have a chipper (beta amylase) which is good at taking the branches and twigs and cutting them into little pieces that are easy to use.  The two enzymes need to do their work together to make the most fermentable sugars out of the starches stored in the grains.  Alpha amylase is good at breaking the limbs apart into long starch chains but these are not easy for yeast to ferment.  Beta amylase is great at making small glucose chains that the yeast can convert but the big limbs are too big to get into the chipper, if the alpha amylase doesn\'t do its job first the beta amylase cant do its job well.  </p>\n\n<p>The kicker is each enzyme works in a specific temperature range (beta amylase 131-150°F and alpha amylase 154-162°F).  A brewer can manipulate the mash temperature to ensure both enzymes are working with an overlapping temperature (for instance 152°F) or adjust the temperature up or down to accentuate one enzyme over the other.  For instance if we mashed at 158°F the beta amylase will denature and not affect the beer, while the alpha amylase will be very happy and busy.  This will result in more long starch molecules in the beer which are harder for yeast to ferment and result in a sweeter beer!</p>\n\n<p>Unfermentable sugars can also come from specialty grains added to the beer for flavor and intentional sweetness.  The usual suspects are roasted grains where the sugars inside the grain will start to caramelize such as Dark caramel and roasted malts like Crystal 80, Crystal 120, Special B, Chocolate Malt, and Roast Barley.

Sometimes beer in the bottle is pasteurized, while the keg is not. Sometimes one or the other is filtered, while the other is not. The gas content can also differ, since this is adjustable in draught systems but not with bottles.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, such as when yeast content is very important for the flavor profile of a beer, like German Hefeweizen, how much yeast you get in your glass has a big impact on the drinking experience. When drinking from the bottle, you can make sure that you get all of the yeast from the bottom of the bottle into your glass by agitating the last few ounces of beer, but this isn\'t possible with a keg. \nKegged versions of these beers still have yeast in them, but you\'re not getting that perfect ratio in every glass. In my two years as a beer enthusiast living in Germany, these beers are almost always served from the bottle, and every bar or bartender has their preferred method for getting all the yeast out of a bottle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question two</strong>: What is done to bottled beer to prolong its shelf life?\nThis also differs from beer to beer. Some imports are pasteurized in the bottle, some others, namely MillerCoors products, use proprietary hop derivatives like Tetrahop to keep hop flavor while minimizing hop oils\' susceptibility to producing off-flavors due to light exposure. This isn\'t a bad or unnatural thing, and I hope this becomes more widespread, because skunked, lightstruck beer is awful. (see <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/03/131785456/Searching-For-Science-In-A-Glass-of-Beer\" rel=\"nofollow\">this interview</a>) This, however, is also present in kegged beer, as it has other beneficial properties like increased head retention.\nSometimes, though, nothing is done beyond packaging, like Sierra Nevada\'s transition from twist-off to pry-off caps a few years ago to combat leaking, infection, and oxidation. <a href=\"http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/sierra-nevadas-new-pry-off-cap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brookston Beer Blog 2007</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question three</strong>: Why is draught so much better?\nVery, very subjective, and you may want to clarify or qualify this in the future. Is good draught beer better than old, skunked bottled beer? Yes. Is good bottled beer better than flat draught beer poured through dirty lines? Also yes. Each has its pros and cons when it comes to service and storage.</p>\n\n<p>I would venture to say that much of draught beer\'s appeal comes from it being special- you typically have to go somewhere else to get it in a way that\'s not usually available to the home user, like how the theater experience differs from the home movie experience.

At high temperature (68c) you get almost only unfermentable sugar, which will give you a sweet result, while mashing at 64 will give you fermentable sugar and therefore a dry product. </p>\n\n<p>Water does not add so much to the flavour in it self as it helps other parts of the recipe add a certain flavour.

It\'s a pure marketing thing. It\'s like you being a famous person and associating your name with some product, whatever it is, just because you know people will buy it only because of your image/name, and not because of what is really inside of it.</p>\n\n<p>Particularly, I think this is pure opportunism.</p>\n','2016-02-11 13:25:48'),(4823,4338,'<p>In addition to blending different beers (like, blending an stout with an IPA, getting something like a black IPA), it\'s important to mention that almost all barrel aged beers are blends, because of the very nature of barrel aging.</p>\n\n<p>When I mention barrel aged beers, I\'m not just referring to the recent barrel aged styles which have been created by the american craft beer scene, but also to more traditional ones like the Belgian ones: lambic, flanders red and oud bruin.</p>\n\n<p>Blending is crucial to beverages aged on barrels (even whisky or wine), because you never get a regular result from them. It depends heavily on the barrel itself (remember, it\'s wood, a biological element), the storage conditions of each of them (temperature, for example, which varies depending on the position of it in the warehouse) and some other random factors. So, the only way to achieve a consistent and reproducible product is blending, trying to fuse all those different characteristics in the right proportion, giving you an expected final product. In this process, is even common having to dump some barrels, which will not make it on the final proportion (maybe, let\'s say, you have too many very sour barrels, and you don\'t want your beer to be so that sour).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, another common practice is to blend aged beer with the young (not aged) version of it. Beers like Rodenbach, for example, are like this (Rodenbach Grand Cru has 2/3 of aged beer with 1/3 of fresh beer). Dogfish\'s Burton Barton is a blend of wood-aged and fresh IPA, as well.</p>\n\n<p>So, blending beer is not exactly a new thing.

So, in those cases, first you need to figure out the given shelf-life of it, and count backwards, to know when it was bottled. Pretty messy.

A three character code is now included on the new back label of the bottle. The code works like this:</p>\n  \n  <p>The first character is always numeric and represents the last digit of the year. The second character is always alpha and represents the month by using the first letter of the month unless that letter has already been used:</p>\n  \n  <p>January: J, February: F, March: M, April: A, May: Y, June: U, July: L,  August: G, September: S, October: O, November: N, December: D</p>\n  \n  <p>The third character in the code is either alpha or numeric and tells the day of the month.

The keg to tap resistance must be matched by the gas tank push pressure. The gas pressure puts in a little CO2, the liquid line squeezes a little out. However, in long draw setups where the draft line has a lot of resistance the push pressure would have be so high that a lot more CO2 would be dissolved into the beer.  The amount of CO2 squeezed out would cause very foamy beer. How to solve this?  Mix in some Nitrogen.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the <strong>Nitrogen will never blend into the beer.</strong>  It is used as an inert gas to maintain the pressure in long draw lines.  Any change in carbonation would come from the mix ratio.  If the mix is too low in CO2, as the keg empties the beer will go flat since not enough CO2 is being forced in.  If the mix is too high in CO2 then the beer would gain carbonation from the beer gas.</p>\n\n<p>Your ratio of 30% CO2 / 70% N is more suited to a Nitro tap setup.  Traditional nitro beers have an original carbonation level of around 1-1.5 volumes of CO2.  The amount of CO2 needed to maintain this carbonation level is minimal <em>PLUS</em> the faucets that pour these beers have an extra plate that restricts the flow even more, forcing almost all gas out of the beer.  Without that specialized faucet, the beer coming out would just be flat with maybe a few sad bubbles of CO2 but no thick head of foam that you\'d expect.  </p>\n','2016-02-17 22:06:33'),(4835,5107,'<p>Evil Twin Yin &amp; Yang is one popular blend.

The common grain at the time was 6-row malt, today the most <a href=\"http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/zymurgy/zymurgy-extra-2-row-vs-6-row-barley/\">common brewing barley is 2-row</a>. </li>\n<li>Understanding of the malting process has drastically improved. Today we understand how to <a href=\"http://www.brewery.org/brewery/library/Malt.html\">get perfectly malted barley</a>. Historically the malt would have been over or under modified.  Under modified would have lots of unconverted starch which would leave a hazy beer that tasted rather bready. Over modified malt would would have no starch, but less sugar than possible so the resulting beer may lack body.</li>\n<li>Kiln dryers allow for greater variety of malt. By controlling the heat cycle, the same variety of <a href=\"http://hbd.org/brewery/library/Malt_AK0996.html\">barley can make different malt</a>.  Drying the grain in medieval times consisted of heating it over a fire.  Fire dried grains would have a smokey flavor that would be present in the beer.  The traditional Scottish Ale uses malt that has been dried over a fire where the fuel is peat, which is a very distinct smoke flavor.  The fire also was not nearly as exact or even as a modern kiln so some kernels would be burnt and other may be under cooked, so to speak. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Water</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Needless to say, but water purity is drastcally better today than in the 6th-15th centuries.  Because the brewing process boils the water, the beer was safer to drink than the water. Hence the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_of_Soissons\">patron saint of brewers</a> said \"Drink beer, not water.\"</li>\n<li>Dissolved mineral content of water and pH control.  Medieval brewers had the water that they had.  Today, a brewer can start with distilled water and add whatever minerals they desire to change the flavor profile and pH of the mash.  The water pH can effect the mash efficiency and fermentation profile of the beer.  This lack of water control lead to specific styles coming from specific areas. I.E. Burton upon Trent is known for pale ales, Pilsen for golden pilsners, Munich for malty lagers.<a href=\"http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/understanding-the-mash-ph/balancing-the-malts-and-minerals\">Some water source mineral content.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Hops</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ancient beers were not hoppy. Hops were not used extensively in beer until about the 12th century and were not cultivated en mass until about the <a href=\"http://www.britishhops.org.uk/history-of-hops/\">13th century</a>.  <a href=\"http://beer.stackexchange.com/a/4643/4637\">Most beers older than that were bittered with Gruit.</a>.</li>\n<li>The hops that were used were not high in bittering acids.  The oldest common hop varieties are the <a href=\"http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/02/05/noble-hops-for-european-beer-styles/\">Noble hops</a>.  Just like today, costs of ingredients was a major factor in brewing.  Making a really hoppy beer was prohibitively expensive.  Just compare an English IPA brewed from old recipes vs. an American IPA.   </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Yeast and Microbiology</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is where modern technology really helps out.  Louis Pasteur discovered yeast in 1857. Up until that time, the changing of sugar into alcohol was considered magic or an act of god.  It was understood that the foam on top of a fermenting wort could be passed around to other vats of wort to start the process (<a href=\"http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/exploring-the-german-technique-of-krausening/\">Krausening</a>). Others would transfer <a href=\"http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000103.html\">Magic Sticks</a> from batch to batch to start fermentation.</li>\n<li>There are other microorganisms that can inhabit beer. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces_bruxellensis\">Brettanomyces</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus\">Lactobacillus</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediococcus\">Pediococcus</a> to name a few.  These can cause a sour, acidic flavor in beer.  Some ancient breweries would just let the cold night air in through an open window in order to cool the freshly boiled wort, exposing the warm sugar solution to whatever might land on it.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Thermometers - The temperature of the mash can affect the fermentabilty of the wort. The temperature of the malting and drying affect the sugar content of malted barley.</li>\n<li>Chemical cleaners - All of the brewing equipment is sanitary. Modern living through chemistry.</li>\n<li>Food storage/availability - I can get whatever ingredients I want, whenever I need them.</li>\n<li>Refrigeration - I can cool the wort in controlled conditions.

The alcohol content would be lower as well.</li>\n<li>Ancient beers would not be hoppy.</li>\n<li>Ancient beers would have to be drunk quickly before they spoiled.  The other bugs in the beer would turn the beer bad after a few weeks.  This also prevented the beer from traveling very from from the brewery.</li>\n<li>Ancient beers could vary greatly, batch to batch.  The brewers of the times were very skilled with what they could work with, but they were constrained by what ingredients they could use, whether by law or availability.

Suppose that 1% ABV corresponded to 1 \"alcohol unit.\" If, for example, your body could process 4.5 alcohol units/hour, after 6 pints of a 5% ABV beer (1/hr), you\'d have 3 alcohol units left in your body [(5.0-4.5)*6]. However, you\'d reach the same mark after only 2 beers (1/hr) of a 6% ABV beer [(6-4.5)*2].</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR Version: It probably has to do with the beer\'s ABV you were drinking.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: There is a lot of variability in strength within any given style.

Beef steak has lots of strong flavor from the meat itself and from smoke, marinade, sauce, or pepper, so it calls for choosing a wine that is also full-bodied. Cabernet Sauvignon’s robust fruit tastes and powerful flavors can stand up to most any steak. The tannins in Cabernet Sauvignon (coming mainly from the red skin of the grape)  and relatively high alcohol levels also help cut through the fat of the steak, making the wine taste smoother and less bitter… and the steak more flavorful.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>California Zinfandel</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Zinfandel has moderate tannins and high acidity, making it a fitting match with steaks that contain relatively good amounts of fat. Rib Eye, T-Bone or Porterhouse steaks are ideal partners for Zinfandel. A little less refined than  Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel has a characteristically bold grapey spiciness and thick richness on the pallet.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Malbec</strong> </p>\n\n<p>\"Malbec is an up and coming red wine that is definitely steak friendly. In fact, Malbec is the number one consumed red wine in Argentina where it’s considered the ideal wine to pair with beef.

You won’t be disappointed.\" </p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Good Red Wine Pairings with Steak</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"The classic wine choices to pair with grilled steaks are big, bold red wines, especially California Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.  Merlot, Syrah (Shiraz from Australia), Sangiovese, Chianti and Pinot Noir are also good choices and will produce softer red wine and steak pairings, which you may prefer depending on the steak, the doneness you prefer and whatever else you are serving.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosés, Blush Wine and Sparkling Wines</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Not to be forgotten, a crisp chilled Rosé wine or a bubbly Sparkling Wine (especially brut or rosé) is  almost always an enjoyable pairing with steak and other grilled fare.

Exposing wine to air for a short time, or allowing it to oxidize, can help soften flavors and release aromas in a way similar to swirling the wine in your glass. Young red wines, especially those that are high in tannin, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, most Red Zinfandel, Bordeaux and many wines from the Rhône Valley, actually taste better with aeration because their tannins soften and the wine becomes less harsh. Another method of aerating a young, tannic red wine is to roughly decant it into another container, which exposes more of the wine\'s surface to air than simply removing the cork from the bottle. Uncorking a bottle and letting it sit undisturbed for period of time actually does very little to let the wine breathe as only a small percentage of the wine is in contact with air. A much better suggestion is aerating the wine in your glass or in a wine decanter. A decanter is defined as any vessel other than the original bottle that will hold the contents of the wine and allow for air to mix with the wine within. Usually, these are broad-bottomed glass or crystal containers. </p>\n  \n  <p>Wine and air may have a negative effect on each other. To simplify, let us consider the following: </p>\n  \n  <p>• Wine poured from a bottle into a glass and swirled is positive since the air mixture allows aromas to be displayed</p>\n  \n  <p>• Wine that has had a brief exposure to air is positive since it allows wine to breathe similar to stretching its legs after being cooped up in the bottle for so many years. This exposure has a positive effect on the wine after 25 to 30 minutes. Intensely tannic or younger reds may need up to a few hours. In general, most red and white wines will improve within the first half hour of opening the bottle. </p>\n  \n  <p>• Extended exposure to air has a negative effect on the wine. After a day, the wine may obtain a vinegary smell or taste. Red wines and sweet white wines may last a little longer due to the natural preservatives of tannins and sugar. Refrigeration may be used to extend the life of white wine. </p>\n</blockquote>\n','2016-05-11 12:49:35'),(5005,5431,'<p>I received a bottle of <a href=\"http://highlandpark.co.uk/shop/einar/\">Highland Park Einar</a>.

Bourbon also needs to be stored in new charred-oak barrels, whereas whiskey barrels do need to be oak but not new or charred. \"Lastly, to be called bourbon, the liquid needs to be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125.\" For other whiskies the liquid must be distilled to no more than 190 proof.

Sometimes the \'King\'s shilling\' was hidden in the bottom of a pewter tankard (having drunk his pint, the unfortunate drinker found that he had unwittingly accepted the King\'s offer).

A third less common type would be spontaneous fermentation (a natural beer fermentation process taking place in the wild). Typically, only one fermentation process occurs during production (either bottom, top, or spontaneous fermentation). It basically describes what happens to the yeast during fermentation- some yeast float to the top of the liquid during fermentation, while some types of yeast sink to the bottom. Which type of fermentation takes place, depends on the type of yeast used in the process. So to answer your question, if it effects the type of drink (and taste), the answer is yes. It\'s not so much whether the yeast sink to the bottom or float to the top that affects the taste/style, but it is rather due to the type of yeast which determines what will happen to during fermentation (float to top/sink to bottom).

However, it does offer gin recommendations for various types of gin. Their number one all around recommendation is in fact <strong>Greylock.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Plymouth</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Plymouth is technically both a style and a brand – how’s that for pizzazz? Plymouth is remarkably gentle. It has a sweet, delicate nose and a woodsy, lemony body. You might even get a bit of cinnamon bark on the palate. The finish is quite smooth, making Plymouth ideal for the bare bones martini. If the idea of drinking a cocktail that’s basically straight liquor freaks you out, Plymouth is a great gin to start with. It’s so welcoming, the first few sips of your martini might evolve into gulps. Drink cautiously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2. Bombay Sapphire</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is about as old timey as it gets. Savory, agreeable, and wonderfully cohesive, Bombay Sapphire is a gin that was born to hang out in a martini. While this low-key gin runs the risk of getting lost in fruitier cocktails, it rests perfectly alongside vermouth to create a balanced martini. Sapphire’s traditional botanicals (like coriander and grains of paradise) latch onto one another to make something great. Think of Sapphire as the perfect chocolate chip cookie: it seems simple, but one taste of a failed contender tells you it ain’t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>3. Citadelle BEST ON A BUDGET</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you’re at a great bar and ask for a basic gin cocktail off-menu, there’s a good shot you’ll be tasting Citadelle. This French gin is a great quality purchase. Plenty of orange and overall citrus give Citadelle a nice burst of fruitiness without being fruit forward per se. While there are some floral notes to work with here, Citadelle really straddles the line between unique and eccentric, making it a great choice for a more aromatic, flavor-packed martini. Plus, at around $25, you don’t have a lot to lose. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>4. Euphrosine #9</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All right, so Euphrosine #9 isn’t exactly traditional. In fact, it’s like you took the floral notes in Citadelle and pumped them up a notch (or three). Still, there’s enough palatable sweetness to make Euphrosine #9 a happy martini gin. If you’re looking for a martini that’s on the sweeter side, reach for this NOLA-born pick from producer Atelier Vie. You’ll pick up on hibiscus, berries, and sweet iced tea. Dare we say it, there’s something rather flirtatious about Euphrosine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>5. The Botanist</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hey, here’s something from Islay that isn’t Scotch! Bruichladdich crafts this interesting gin, which is made from thirty-one botanicals, twenty-two of which are native to Islay. While that may seem like an overwhelming amount of botanicals when compared to the standard seven or eight, The Botanist holds itself together surprisingly well. This is a complex gin, with a floral nose and an herbal palate. We get chamomile, mint, and citrus zest. Because this gin is so layered, you might want to add even less vermouth than usual. When it comes to your standard martini, The Botanist will really do all the talking, and in this case, that’s okay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>6. Gin Mare</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do you prefer your martinis dirty? Then use Gin Mare. Seriously, this Spanish gin seems to be genetically engineered for a dirty martini. In a rare instance where branding fits product, Gin Mare is a Mediterranean gin made with olives, thyme, and rosemary amongst other herbs. The viscosity of the gin, combined with its garden-fresh taste, makes it the ideal spirit for a martini with just a hint of olive tartness. With this spicy yet still contained gin, you’ll feel like you’re going beyond a basic martini. Gin Mare is a great example of how a spirit can be both contemporary and classic at the same time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>7. Terroir</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Made from the gorgeous distillery at St. George’s Spirits, Terroir gin uses local Douglas fir. Unsurprisingly, Terroir gin was created as an homage to California’s natural resources. While drinking “fir” might put you off at first, it seems that the plant works to intensify the juniper, giving us a gin that has classic pine notes. This gin has a generous layer of crisp juniper bite, yet there’s a certain earthiness to it that prevents it from being too harsh or simplistic. Expect grassy notes, moss, tree sap, and of course, a heavy coat of juniper to round this all up. Like Bombay Sapphire, this gin is as solid as a California redwood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>8. Greylock BEST OVERALL</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This mighty gin from Berkshire Mountain Distillers has received tons of praise – and rightfully so. Straightforward, London Dry, and clean as a whistle, Greylock is a fantastic martini gin. Spicy licorice combined with lemon peel, black pepper, and a touch of cooking spice make Greylock both approachable and complex. Greylock will add lip-smacking flavor to your martini while still boasting enough unique spiciness to make your cocktail truly special. A hint of sugar-coated juniper berry will give way to just enough sweetness to make your martini quaffable as can be. This is an A+ gin for making martinis – we guarantee your guests will be happy with this crowd-pleaser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>9. Dorothy Parker</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Named after satirical poet and general snark icon Dorothy Parker, this gin from New York Distilling Company would make Ms. Parker proud. Similar to Euphrosine #9, the floral nose is rich with hibiscus, elderflower, pear, and cranberries. The juniper peaks its head around on the blooming palate and the finish, which is zesty. While this is half a world away from Greylock, it’s perfect if you’re looking to whip up a martini that’s a little lighter, bubblier, and of course, a bit more tart – like Ms. Parker herself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Recommendation are always a hard subject to put across to others because what one person may enjoy, another may find less than favorable!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/how-to/a1560/martini-gins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Town and Country Magazine</a> offers their <strong>5 of the Best Gins for a Classic Martini.</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Boodles</p></li>\n<li><p>Tanqueray</p></li>\n<li><p>St. George</p></li>\n<li><p>Aviation</p></li>\n<li><p>Berkshire Mountain Distillers Greylock</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Personally I am a fan of <strong>Beefeater</strong> as is seen <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/04/best-gin-for-a-martini-cocktail-taste-test-fords-beefeater-bombay-plymouth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> from <strong>The Best Gin for a Martini!</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Ford\'s Gin</p></li>\n<li><p>Beefeater</p></li>\n<li><p>Bombay Dry</p></li>\n<li><p>Plymouth Gin</p></li>\n<li><p>Bombay Sapphire</p></li>\n</ol>\n','2016-06-11 13:23:25'),(5084,5064,'<p>The other day, I was in a specialty wine store and noticed several bottles of wines priced between $500 and $5,000!</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way of knowing (historically or otherwise) that a particular exorbitantly priced bottle of wine is a well flavored wine?

My preference is always for cask ale to be served cool, but not cold, so that the flavours can be properly appreciated. Good quality lager should be served colder, and I prefer Czech pilsners at around 6-8 C - about the same temperature as you\'d want white wine to be. But on a burning hot day in the African sunshine (where I\'m from), there is nothing as refreshing as an ice-cold (and I mean <strong>ice</strong>-cold) ordinary mass-market lager, straight out of the bottle.

The biggest is that TCP only measures a specific component of smoke flavor, and in fact one of somewhat less importance. TCP is responsible for the sharp, chemical smoke flavor. However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon\">polycyclic aromatics</a> are responsible for the majority of \"smoke\" flavor. In fact, many fuels, such as wood, create relatively low proportions of TCP compared to peat. As such, it is more of a ballpark figure, and even then only if you are discussing alcohols smoked with the same fuels.</p>\n\n<p>Because of those different compounds, the actual nature of smoke flavors vary wildly depending on the fuel and its origin, not just how much of it is used. Here are some examples of how I would classify the smoke flavor of various alcohols:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Laphraoig: Cigar smoke</li>\n<li>Ardbeg: Bonfire, \"iodine\"</li>\n<li>Highland Park: Bacon</li>\n<li>Octomore: Chemical, biting</li>\n<li>Vita (Mezcal, not Scotch): A forest fire</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As implied by the terminology I chose, it can be difficult to separate the smoke taste from the other tastes involved. There is even disagreement as to what constitutes \"smoke\"/\"peatiness\" - are \"iodine\" and/or \"phenol\" part of it, or entirely separate? If they are separate, can people reasonably separate them in tasting?</p>\n\n<p>I am skeptical how useful a number could possibly be with the wide variety of smoke flavors to discuss. It\'s not just that the number would amalgamate many distinct flavors, it\'s also that different people are differently sensitive to the varying flavor compounds and might find the numbers ill-represent their actual experience because of that. </p>\n\n<p>As such, any number you might come up with is going to have a wide margin of error, since no one is going to agree on how \"smokey\" a given alcohol is.</p>\n\n<p>It is of course theoretically possible to generate a number based on analysis of many different flavor compounds. However, that has not been done, and likely will not be. Even if it was, people would still have differing sensitivities. The closest you are likely to get is TCP ppm measurements and arbitrary numbers offered by reviewers.</p>\n','2016-06-14 20:38:20'),(5098,5561,'<p>I don\'t know if you know what sake is sake is traditional wine that served hot I have experience cold and hot it a lot taster when it hot try some go to a Japanese store ask them u want to try hot sake </p>\n','2016-06-14 22:03:18'),(5100,5064,'<p><strong>Why is it that some beers are served Cold and why are some served Warm?</strong></p>\n\n<p>At what temperature should a beer be served can be answered by the following statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most beers have an ideal serving temperature. There’s a chart below outlining which styles are served at what temperature, but as a general rule the temperature at which to serve a beer is correlated to the strength of the beer. <strong>As beers go up in alcohol, they are generally drunk at a warmer temperature.</strong> This is because stronger beers often are sipped slowly, and enjoyed for their complexity of flavor and aroma while weaker beers are often consumed for refreshment.

They only use one belgian caramel malt but which one they use is a secret so I figured it would be best to use a little of each (Sean Paxton does the same in his clone).</li>\n<li>Carafa III is used mainly for some color (the candi syrup isn\'t dark enough alone) and for some aroma and body and flavor stability.</li>\n<li>It isn\'t possible to get the real light and dark candy sugar used by Rochefort and I feel that D2 and amber candi syrup are the highest quality and closest we can get.</li>\n<li>Sugars are reportedly 20% of the fermentables (as they are in my recipe)</li>\n<li>Rochefort says they use wheat starch (used to be corn) which should add some dryness and some head retention and body. Sean Paxton says it is about 5% of the fermentables (as it is my recipe).</li>\n<li>Sean Paxton claims they use 3 step mash is used with a protein rest at 122 and a saccharification rest in the \"mid-low 150s\". 153 seemed to be a good number in the mid-low 150s.</li>\n<li>While Rochefort likely doesn\'t use a decoction mash, I\'ve found that decoction mashes give better efficiency, better flavor, and better fementability for a minimal amount of additional effort.</li>\n<li>The bittering hops are the \"traditional belgian hops\". I\'m guessing Styrian Goldings. The flavor hops are a German hop. I\'m guessing Hallertauer Hersbrucker. The hops are fairly subtle in this beer so those guesses are likely close enough if they aren\'t correct.</li>\n<li>Rochefort centrifuges and bottles rather quickly but since most homebrewers don\'t have access to a centrifuge, 6 weeks of cold conditioning should suffice.</li>\n<li>A starter should be used, but should be slightly under-pitched in order to get the yeast to produce the desire esters.</li>\n<li>Still not sure on the amount of flavor hops vs bittering hops but IBUs should be 27 according to BLAM.</li>\n<li>I\'m tempted to pitch colder at 65 and let rise to 80 as I do with Westmalle yeast but I\'m not sure if that will work with Rochefort yeast or if I\'ll get horrible fusel alcohols. For now, I\'ll try 68-73 as Rochefort does.</li>\n<li>Rochefort ferments beers on top of older beers. I wonder if this is possible to replicate by starting with pitching into just 1/4 of the wort and adding an additional 1/4 more wort each day for three days.

I\'ve never read of any type of mead that WORSENS with proper aging. So either you just don\'t like dry mead (maybe try carbonating it?) or you have contamination ruining your mead independent of what type it is. Alas, it is hard to find commercial meads to see what you actually like. Chaucers is wretched.

You can only stop further damage, not reverse what has\n  already occurred. Worse, if a vinegar infection got into your Mead,\n  it\'s undoubtedly living in your brewing system somewhere. Go after it\n  with a vengeance. Sanitize everything post haste, maybe even throwing\n  out all of your siphon hoses (acetobacteria loves to hide there). Make\n  sure there is a good seal on your air-locks. </p>\n  \n  <p>If you have done all of this, and your Mead still tastes terrible\n  after six months, try again. Examine all of your sanitation\n  procedures, especially bottle washing. Make sure that any herbs or\n  raisins or whatever that you might have added were not a source of\n  bacterial infection. Most foul tastes are the result either of\n  sterilizer contamination or bacterial infection. If you used an exotic\n  ingredient, such as papaya peel, maybe you should try a new recipe.\n  Maybe aging will solve the problem, maybe not.

Beers like Becks, Heineken, Amstel, Yuengling, Miller/Coors/Budweiser, etc. aren\'t as strongly hopped as IPAs.  Nonetheless, hops are still the primary flavoring agent in these beers.</p>\n\n<p>Some background first.  Hops are flowers.  Their bitter flavor comes from the release of the flower\'s alpha acids, which are among the most prominent resins and volatile oils within the flower itself.  These alpha acids are extremely sensitive to oxygen and begin to break down upon exposure to oxygen -- even the trace amounts inside a sealed bottle or keg.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, any beer relying on hops as a primary flavoring agent is essentially \"on the clock\" from the time it\'s brewed.  When fresh (&lt;30 days after bottling/kegging), these hops taste as they were intended.  As time progresses, the hop flavors fade and are replaced by a skunky hop flavor which some people (myself included) perceive as being overly bitter.  Advanced palates can distinguish between these flavors, but it\'s often difficult to separate them without proper training.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, most mass-market beers (including all of the above) are pasteurized.  Anything that\'s been pasteurized will have a shelf life.  General guidelines are to avoid anything older than ~90 days for pasteurized beer, and try to find &lt;30 days when possible.  I check bottling dates religiously before making a purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Note that some types of unpasteurized beer (Ex: traditional Belgian lambic) actually <em>improve</em> with age and can be cellared under proper conditions for upwards of 30 years!</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is due to the Heineken flavor profile itself.  Just as alpha acids are sensitive to oxygen, the malted grain in beer is quite sensitive to direct sunlight.  Even 15-20 minutes of exposure to the sun can irreparably skunk a beer.  This is why most beer bottles are dark in color and 6pk holders have high cardboard sides.</p>\n\n<p>Even though both Becks and Heineken are sold in green bottles, which allow significantly more light through than dark bottles, the Heineken flavor profile is decidedly more skunky.  And that\'s not to say it\'s bad; it\'s simply part of the flavor profile they have nurtured.  This skunky malt flavor is the dominant flavor in Heineken, and it frequently masks some of the underlying hop bitterness -- including bitterness from aged hops.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to see what this flavor tastes like, grab two cans of Bud/Miller/Coors Light.  Pour one into a clear glass and put it in direct sunlight for 15-20 minutes.  Pour the other one at the same time but leave it in an opaque container shielded from sunlight.  It\'s a pretty distinctive flavor.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, everyone\'s tastebuds perceive flavors a little differently.  It\'s entirely possible that another person tasting the same two beers from the exact same bottles comes to a different conclusion about bitterness.</p>\n\n<p>In short, there are a number of factors at play here, and it may require a bit of effort to isolate them.  But hey, that\'s the fun part!</p>\n','2016-07-21 19:36:22'),(5211,5508,'<p>This, \"The idea here is that you are extracting calcium carbonate from the shells, which helps reduce the tannic astringency that can result from the roasted grains used in stouts.\" from John, was most helpful and logical.

To do this in the bottle i. e. to simply uncork or unscrew the bottle and leave it is virtually pointless. The surface area of the wine exposed, coupled with the poor gas-liquid transfer means any change would in all likelihood, be undetectable. There would be more aeration occurring by the simple act of pouring the wine into a glass. The best method is to swirl the wine in a vessel. A wide decanter is best, but leave settling time (of solids) for older wines. A wide wineglass (where the glass is about the width of a bottle)  also works.  Ideally,  one would pour the wine into decanter where the volume of wine places the liquid level at the widest part of the vessel.  A good swirl maximises aeration /oxidation.  Give it time before pouring without the temperature rising too much above the ideal. Then, pouring from decanter to glass aerates further. This method is especially true for red wines. For white wines, more effective aeration is enacted by sucking the wine through the front teeth with air (almost slurping but only once the wine is in the front part of the mouth) while sipping from the glass.

However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the claim that drinking any type of milk (even buttermilk) before consuming alcohol does anything to stave off or reduce hangovers.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, it is well known that alcohol consumption slows digestion and reduces absorption of nutrients, especially those found in milk. This is because the alcohol reduces the secretion of digestive enzymes, which are what breaks down food in the stomach, including milk proteins and sugars. Alcohol also increases acid levels in the stomach, but it doesn\'t typically cause major negative side effects, when consumed in moderation, unless there is already another medical factor present. </p>\n\n<p>High levels of milk or creams, followed by excessive alcohol intake can produce effects similar to lactose intolerance, because the milk sugars are not digested well and move into the intestines. Once excess sugars are in the intestines, the bacteria there consumes the sugars and produces large amounts of gas. High levels of sugar in the intestines also causes more-than-normal amounts of water to be drawn into the intestines...a.k.a. \"diarrhea\".</p>\n\n<p>As long as you aren\'t eating cheese curd sandwiches, made with flourless (i.e. all-cheese) cheese bread, with 5 slices of cheese and cheese soup, followed by high levels of alcohol, you should be fine.

Of course, because of that same alcohol content, you need to be sure to store them in a cool place. Above a radiator is not the right answer.</p>\n  \n  <p>Spirits do not \"get better\" in the bottle; they do not generally develop additional flavors in glass. For a spirit to age in the sense that we mean when talking of aged spirits, they need to age in wood. Glass doesn\'t impart additional flavor or aroma.</p>\n  \n  <p>Two things will happen to spirits in glass, however: <strong>oxidation and evaporation.</strong> As the booze reacts with oxygen, its flavors diminish over time. For short periods, this effect is subtle. Keep an open bottle of bourbon around a couple of months, and you probably won\'t notice any difference. Store it for years, though, and you might find it tastes a little flatter than when it was brand new.</p>\n  \n  <p>A small amount of evaporation from the bottle is inevitable and unavoidable; to make sure it stays just a small amount, though, remember what I said before: keep the booze in a cool place.</p>\n  \n  <p>But say you have a special bottle, something you want to keep around for a long time, and sip slowly over years. How can you protect the stuff inside? The simple answer is, <strong>transfer it into a smaller bottle.</strong> A few remaining ounces of that perfect single-malt, stored in its original bottle, will continue to react with the oxygen that fills up the bottle. A smaller vessel simply has less room for that spirit-snuffing oxygen.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, is this necessary? Probably only if you\'re a collector or true spirits enthusiast.

I make homemade bitters with ginger, grapefruit, gentian root, and several spices that seem to be the most effective. Bitter herbal liqueurs are popular in Europe for before or after a meal to stimulate the appetite or aid digestion.</p>\n\n<p>Gentian root is one of the most common bitter agents. While I don\'t know of any clinical studies, gentian root has been used in herbal medicine for centuries to treat digestive issues. It makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bitter compounds are mostly found in plants and are often more or less poisonous. If the body produces more digestive enzymes in response to bitter flavors, the extra enzymes can neutralize the poison or extract more nutrition from the plant material. It\'s certainly not totally effective, salivary enzymes won\'t save you from hemlock poisoning, but it could reduce the ill effects of mild poisons. </p>\n','2016-08-31 20:40:13'),(6270,5816,'<p>In the UK, I never came across a \"beer cocktail\", certainly not one spiked with strong spirits (hard liquor in AmE) like vodka or tequila. I\'m somewhat <em>surprised</em> (British understatement) that the OP needs to do this to a good glass of beer in order to \"make it a good party\" [sic]. Doing this is just as likely to ruin the enjoyment of the vodka/tequila and vice-versa the beer. Such adulteration of these two mutually exclusive beverages is an abomination. Evidently the hoped for effect of spiking beer in this way is to encourage inebriation among the party goers. Not the sort of thing that makes a \"good party\" in my experience. Beer \"cocktails\" of a more benign kind in the UK also include a \"shandy\", traditional beer to which non-alcoholic fizzy lemonade is added. In the UK, another beer cocktail of sorts is the \"Black &amp; Tan\", a fifty-fifty mixture of traditional beer or pale ale with dark porter or stout (typically Guinness)  I think the Scots got it right when they embraced the \"beer-chaser\", a pint of traditional beer ordered with a wee dram of Scotch (whiskey) on the side, served separately in a glass tot. A beer \"cocktail\" of this kind, drunk in tandem with each other, is so much more appealing than throwing hard liquor in with a good beer and vice versa. </p>\n','2016-09-01 02:49:40'),(6271,5822,'<p>I used to work with a group of Russians. They introduced me to Wodka and told me that Wodka will never give you a hangover if you stick to Wodka only - and don\'t drink any other alcoholic beverages shortly before, in between or after. The reasoning was that hangovers feel like they do not so much because of the alcohol, but because of impurities. Good Wodka consists of extremely little impurities (a large part of it is just alcohol and water) and thus apparently is less likely to cause a hangover.</p>\n\n<p>I found this to be true, provided the Wodka is of reasonable quality (Stolichnaya seemed to work well in this respect) and enough water is taken to avoid dehydration.</p>\n','2016-09-02 06:14:00'),(6272,5654,'<p><strong>Two things have to be considered</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first, as Lying Dog said, is impurities. In fact, if they give taste, they also give you hangover</li>\n<li>The second, much more important is the fact that alcohol is diuretic. Once drunk, the alcohol is converted into several substances (in several steps) by your liver. The problem is once the last substances cannot be converted into anything useful, it will be ejected from your body. How ? By urinating. But urinating requires water. The problem is that if you do not drink water as much as needed, your body will take it from where it can, including from your brain. Now think about a sponge left without water inside and you\'ll have a good idea of what your brain looks like after a night, inducing hangover the next morning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>To answer your question</strong>, yes, Vodka is the most efficient alcohol to avoid hangover. But you can also avoid it by drink enough water while drinking alcohol (typically, if I\'m at a party where I drink a lot of alcohol, I drink a pint of water after 2 or 3 beers)</p>\n','2016-09-02 12:08:54');
