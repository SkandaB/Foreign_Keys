Two of the three methods of fermenting grains work on other starches as well, so starchy roots could have been fermented before large scale grain agriculture (the hallmark of the neolithic).  Over here in SE Asia, for example, breadfruit, cassava root, yams, etc are sometimes fermented into an alcoholic paste, and the same technique applied to rice yields a sort of mixture of read yeast rice and red rice beer that people eat together.",
